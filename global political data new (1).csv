Africa has 54 countries in the African continent itself and you don't see them forcing every country in the continent to unite as one. Why?

"Indians are defeated by the Chinese in the 1962 war. It was the most humiliating defeat in history if you were to examine all the facts that were involved in the war. This is the ultimate proof that war tactics/strategy/determination/will power/bravery triumphs over superior weapons/technology/cowardice.
1) The Chinese were having the ""great Chinese famine"" from 1658 to 1962. China was too weak to defend itself.
2) India had Israeli and American support in the form of supplies/weaponry. Research on ""Israel aid to India in the 1962 war"" and ""America's aid to India in the 1962 war"" and ""JFK’s Forgotten Crisis"".
3) The Sino-Soviet split from 1960 - 1962. China had nothing. No weapons, guns, artillery supplies from either Western and Soviet and no food (serious famine).
4) Despite all these advantages, India lost. 
5) There are no excuses for such a humiliating defeat. That is why India is so desperate to have the ""Henderson Brooks and Neville Maxwell report of the 1962 war"" concealed forever and also to hide which country is the true aggressor of the war. When it was leaked into the internet momentarily in 2014, India demanded the report to be purged permanently from the internet citing ""national security""....just like BBC's documentary on the 2002 Gujarat Massacre and Modi's involvement.",1

Putin also had the ability to cripple Ukrianes economy and drive it lower, increasing the ease of doing a pro-russian shift. If he wanted he could also have allowed Don and Luhan to declare themselves Republics on their own and increase his campaign range from there the simple fact is Ukriane wanted independence and it knew Putin had always planned genocide and mass deportation for them the NATO partnership was nothing more then a mutually beneficial deal between them and us with Putin never caring anything about the ""threat"" posed by a increasingly pro-west Ukriane",1

The Tritium used in most modern nuclear weapons can be hard to produce in large quantities and Tritium is expensive to produce. Since Tritium has a relatively short half-life and is absolutely crucial to the working of modern nuclear weapons, it needs to be continuously produced to maintain the stockpile.  

Tritium production is something that even the US struggles with, so, the question of Russia's nuclear weapons reliability is on point and relevant.",1

"20% fails to acknowledge the simple fact that for all anyone knows, the number could realistically be 0.

If you thought corruption was rampart on equipment that might actually be used in a war, just wait until you see the corruption on things that would never actually be used, and you'd be dead either way if they were.

This isn't a justification to assume their nukes are all duds, though.  It's simply not worth the risk.",0
"20% working combined with an intercept rate of 75% and medium accuracy (doubtful) would mean around 38 nukes after taking into account the fact that the majority of US and Russian nukes are not primed and ready to go. Most but not all of them directed towards the United States, maybe half towards civilian areas. This would be devastating and catastrophic, but hardly a global disaster or a knockout blow to the United States.",0

" @muslimDeen137  Uranium would produce an Atomic weapon, not a thermonuclear weapon. Believe it or not, there is a big difference. 

Given that Tritium has a half-life of 12 years and the US would not have been able to baseline what weapons were at what decay, no, general inspections do not tell you what state a weapon is in.",1
"​ @donixion4368 Well, a nuclear weapon with ""just"" 20 kilotons is still enough to annihilate a large city. And thermonuclear weapons are ignited by a regular nuke in their core. So even if the tritium fails, there would still be at least a 10 kiloton blast instead of a megaton.",0
" @muslimDeen137  You need more than 1 20 Kt to cover a modern large city. In fact, you would need quite a few to totally destroy, say New York City. 

Russian strategic weapons are Tritium weapons. That is what they are and they would be highly neutered weapons if the Tritium has decayed. In fact, trying to detonate a Tritium-enhanced weapon that is not maintained would mean that the Tritium would have decayed to Helium and Helium tends to be inert.     

This condition would cause an atomic explosion to potentially be greatly reduced in yield.  

In other words, Russia could be sitting on thousands of dud strategic weapons.",1

" @rogerdinhelm4671  - Russia is very corrupted country, so I wouldn't be surprised if the ""nuclear"" budget was defrauded, too...
Anyway, this Russian war on Ukraine already proved, that Russian army, being vastly overrated,

so the question still is open:
if ""nuclear"" budget was run by corrupted officers,
or by talented patriots...",1
Nuclear weapons are high maintenance weapons that are extremely expensive to keep. Russia didn’t maintain truck tires let alone nukes that were planned never to be used. The material inside the nuclear bomb has a half life that depletes quickly over time. None of those weapons work or they would have already been used.,0
" @XaFFaX  yea if you had any idea how modern MIRV nuke warheads like Sarmat work, you wouldnt write such nonsense. Take a ICBM that leaves the atmosfere of the earth before its nose cone opens up and releases 16 x 300 kiloton or 10x 750 kiloton warheada along with decoys, those warheads are designed to evade interception missiles, each of them has a primary and a secondary target, when they enter the atmosphere they do so at a hypersonic speed. Only 20 of those would mean that the world as we know it would end. Its virtually imposible to intercept warheads once they detach from the ICBM. Lets not even talk about their sub launched nukes. Now note that officially russia still has 6000 nuclear weapons in its arsenal, even 20% of those weapons worked its still game ovet",0

" @internet_userr  We're not suffering here in the USA.  I don't wish to disillusion anyone, but I will be cynically  blunt.  We are sending Ukraine our surplus.  We routinely replace enormous amounts of tanks and weaponry on a regular basis, because after a certain date it becomes dangerous to use.  The point at which we dispose of it is just sort of its expiration date, so to speak, so it's still good stuff, if used immediately.  So yes, what we send technically cost us millions of dollars, years ago, that we would have spent whether war had erupted in Ukraine or not, but in fact we are saving money by letting them dispose of it for us. 

The exception is experimental tech.  There, too, we profit, as the Ukrainians field-test it for us for free.

And why shouldn't we send our surplus to a country striving with all of its might for the Western values that we hold dear, against an unjust aggressor?  The great big difference between Ukraine and Russia is that Ukraine has always believed in freedom and longed for it even when it was pried away, whereas the Russians have always believed in submission to the state, no matter how many different kinds of government they try.  Ukrainians stand for what we stand for, and a bully neighbor is trying to crush it out of them.

As for whatever you're going on about regarding free food, housing, or energy, are you actually envying refugees?  People who have had everything they earned through a lifetime of hard work suddenly blown up?  Do you think that they were lucky when they had to crowd into refugee camps in the middle of a deadly pandemic, and now have to scramble for whatever they can get?

What if it was you?  This is not an idle question.  Disasters--from war or otherwise--hit everybody sooner or later.  The people you take care of today will take care of you tomorrow.  It's called being part of society.",1

On another level, callousness to others breeds callousness at home.  The people in this country who object to helping Ukrainians defend themselves generally don't care about the homeless here, either--but they will bring them up if they think they can win points in an argument--that is the beginning and the ending of their caring.  If Ukraine isn't mentioned, and you try to talk about projects to get the homeless into homes, they'll cry out, ""Oh no--I'm not wasting my tax dollars on a bunch of bums!""  That's how they see the homeless, as lazy bums, ignoring the fact that half the homeless people have jobs, and of the other half, many of them only lost their jobs because they became homeless.  I don't see that siding with Russia's supporters would do the homeless any good.

On still another level, once Ukraine comes out of this war victorious, their economy is going to take off, and we will be very glad to have them as economic partners.  We will increase economically together and fewer people in both nations will be homeless.  They will make a much better business partner than corrupt, moribund and uncreative Russia ever did!

"Zelensky had the chance to prevent this conflict through diplomacy. But he lacked the courage and the conviction.

In 2014 there was a coup. Soon after, there was a massacre in Odessa (dozens of people were burned alive). Ethnic Russians living in Ukraine were treated as subhuman. Their language and culture was being oppressed. A civil war broke out due to the rise in ethnic tensions. For 8 years the Ukrainian military was indiscriminately shelling civilians living in Donbas. 

If Zelensky honored the Minsk agreement and pledged neutrality, none of this would have happened. The 8 year civil war would have ended and Donbas would have remained part of Ukraine. War is the ultimate failure of diplomacy.

Zelensky, Poroshenko, Merkel and Hollande admitted that Ukraine had no intention to honor the Minsk agreements.

Who didn't want peace? Who advised against the 2022 peace talks in April? Hint: someone visited Zelensky in Kiev at that time.

Russia's national security was compromised once nato began to expand eastwards. Russia clearly stated that Ukraine joining nato was a red line (November 2021) and unfortunately this concern was never taken seriously. The Russians openly stated: if nothing changes, we will be forced to act in order to defend our national security. Enhancing the national security of one country at the expense of another is unacceptable. The Russians have legitimate security concerns.

20th September, 2021. Ukraine launched military drills with US and nato.

NATO is not a defensive alliance. Nato illegally bombed Yugoslavia (a direct violation of the U.N. Charter).
We should never forget what they did to Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq etc.

Who blew up the pipeline causing an environmental disaster?

Zelensky banned all opposition and recently arrested a leading priest.

Zelensky also tried to invoke article 5 under false pretenses. Remember the incident in Poland.

Ethnic Russians living in Ukraine were treated as subhuman. Their language and culture was being oppressed. 
Poroshenko said, “Our children will go to schools and kindergartens—theirs will hide in the basements”.

Russians will never forget the 2014 Odessa massacre. The whole world needs to know about it.

Why was Denis Kireev eliminated? He was a member of Ukraine's negotiating team during the peace negotiations. He wanted to help his country.

Ukraine has a hit list. They target artists, journalists and ordinary citizens. Hundreds of children are on this list. (13 year old Faina Savenkova was placed on this list.) 
Pink Floyd's Roger Waters is on this list. Jimmy Dore (American stand-up comedian, podcaster) and Aaron Maté (Canadian writer and journalist) are on this list.

There is evidence that Ukrainian troops have been indiscriminately shelling civilians in Donbas. (they used petal mines and targeted areas where there was no military presence). 

The azov troops trapped in the azovstal steelworks in Mariupol used human shields. They refused to allow civilians to leave despite of humanitarian corridors being present. Russia held a proposed cease fire in order for the civilians to leave, but azov would not allow the civilians to leave. 

Ukraine has committed many acts of terrorism (car bombs and other forms of assassination). Darya Dugina (journalist) RIP.

The terrorist attack on the Kerch bridge killed the truck driver and the individuals in the adjacent car (innocent civilian victims). 

I have done a lot of research and it took me a long time to write this comment. I have stated a lot of facts and I have given my honest opinion. 
I have provided a brief summary of events that took place. In order to explain this whole situation in great detail, a book would need to be written.

The reason that Japan attacked the US was because of the sanctions and embargoes the US imposed on it in regards to their campaign in China. There’s a good summary of why they went to war, and why they bombed Pearl Harbor written up by the US navy among others,  In short they basically had three choices all bad, and went with going to war. Agreed if they hadn’t attacked the US they would have been better off, but they were afraid the US would join the conflict when they attacked to get the oil and other resources in the Pacific, so they attacked Pearl Harbor to get some running room hoping to negotiate a peace treaty later on form a position of strength.",0

The case, and video, of the soldier finally agreeing to return to Japan after being ordered to and told the war had ended long ago by his wartime C.O. in the early 1970's was amazing to both read about and watch.

Ukraine has a far superior army but lacks the numbers and willingness to needlessly sacrifice them. Russia has an ineffective army, but no issues sacrificing huge numbers of their people. 

This works out to the stalemate which we see now. The war will stagnate at the river, basically where they are now. Once the fighting slows as both sides exhaust their resources, there will be a weak treaty leaving both sides holding the ground they possess. (pootin will obviously claim victory, and that this is what he wanted from the beginning)

Ukraine will become the most modern country in Europe by way of the construction projects whos contracts are being bid on and signed now(this is real, check it out) while the wastelands occupied by Russia will remain that way as Russia is broke and lacks partners to invest.(China is currently bidding on Ukrainian contracts)

"Zelensky had the chance to prevent this conflict through diplomacy. But he lacked the courage and the conviction.

In 2014 there was a coup. Soon after, there was a massacre in Odessa (dozens of people were burned alive). Ethnic Russians living in Ukraine were treated as subhuman. Their language and culture was being oppressed. A civil war broke out due to the rise in ethnic tensions. For 8 years the Ukrainian military was indiscriminately shelling civilians living in Donbas. 

If Zelensky honored the Minsk agreement and pledged neutrality, none of this would have happened. The 8 year civil war would have ended and Donbas would have remained part of Ukraine. War is the ultimate failure of diplomacy.

Zelensky, Poroshenko, Merkel and Hollande admitted that Ukraine had no intention to honor the Minsk agreements.

Who didn't want peace? Who advised against the 2022 peace talks in April? Hint: someone visited Zelensky in Kiev at that time.

Russia's national security was compromised once nato began to expand eastwards. Russia clearly stated that Ukraine joining nato was a red line (November 2021) and unfortunately this concern was never taken seriously. The Russians openly stated: if nothing changes, we will be forced to act in order to defend our national security. Enhancing the national security of one country at the expense of another is unacceptable. The Russians have legitimate security concerns.

20th September, 2021. Ukraine launched military drills with US and nato.

NATO is not a defensive alliance. Nato illegally bombed Yugoslavia (a direct violation of the U.N. Charter).
We should never forget what they did to Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq etc.

Who blew up the pipeline causing an environmental disaster?

Zelensky banned all opposition and recently arrested a leading priest.

Zelensky also tried to invoke article 5 under false pretenses. Remember the incident in Poland.

Ethnic Russians living in Ukraine were treated as subhuman. Their language and culture was being oppressed. 
Poroshenko said, “Our children will go to schools and kindergartens—theirs will hide in the basements”.

Russians will never forget the 2014 Odessa massacre. The whole world needs to know about it.

Why was Denis Kireev eliminated? He was a member of Ukraine's negotiating team during the peace negotiations. He wanted to help his country.

Ukraine has a hit list. They target artists, journalists and ordinary citizens. Hundreds of children are on this list. (13 year old Faina Savenkova was placed on this list.) 
Pink Floyd's Roger Waters is on this list. Jimmy Dore (American stand-up comedian, podcaster) and Aaron Maté (Canadian writer and journalist) are on this list.

There is evidence that Ukrainian troops have been indiscriminately shelling civilians in Donbas. (they used petal mines and targeted areas where there was no military presence). 

The azov troops trapped in the azovstal steelworks in Mariupol used human shields. They refused to allow civilians to leave despite of humanitarian corridors being present. Russia held a proposed cease fire in order for the civilians to leave, but azov would not allow the civilians to leave. 

Ukraine has committed many acts of terrorism (car bombs and other forms of assassination). Darya Dugina (journalist) RIP.

The terrorist attack on the Kerch bridge killed the truck driver and the individuals in the adjacent car (innocent civilian victims). 

I have done a lot of research and it took me a long time to write this comment. I have stated a lot of facts and I have given my honest opinion. 
I have provided a brief summary of events that took place. In order to explain this whole situation in great detail, a book would need to be written. 
Hopefully someone will write an UNBIASED book, stating facts and allowing the readers to form their own judgments. Everything I said can be fact checked and verified.

In case of Ukraine the demarcation line would be between Ukraine and Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia populated by Ukrainians, who would like to live in Ukraine.

If Russians created some ""People's Republic of Ukraine"" with the promise of autonomy and self governance for people who lived on these territories they might have some success of consolidating their gains.",1

 @gregorycarnielutube how would sharing crimea work though? I think an area has to have a single ownership.,0
" @DamianOchramowicz the referendum they had in that local area wasn’t to become part of Russia; it was to become independent. A part of this conflict remember is about there being pro Russians on that eastern side. Starkly differing to the western Ukrainians. Some of these eastern Ukrainians fought in this war on the Russian side. Many essentially consider themselves Russian apparently. Imagine Russia just pulls out immediately, how do you think attitudes of western Ukrainians will be towards these pro Russian Ukrainians living there afterwards? Far worse than before the war, that’s for sure. And before the war after 2014 thousands of them were killed in internal skirmishes as it was. So on that grounds separating them out into an independent nation or two is actually quite logical from their perspective I think. As with every option here though, getting that to work would be especially difficult. It’d need ideally to be fully considered independent and not being considered a puppet of either side. That way both the Americans and the Russians would be satisfied. But realistically they both would be behind the scenes trying to influence the country sadly. But perhaps they could enshrine military neutrality in their constitution or something. That might be a good start.",1
"THe Korean war as you state is probably the best approach to the Ukraine war. In fact the geopolitical situation is very similar: The States wanted a border with China, in Ukraine it wants a border with Russia. And neither China nor Russia want(ed)  it. But China had no military equipment, Russia has plenty (I dont think we can rely on news reporting  that Russia cant provide enough military equipement. Russian population 145 millions is more of a problem). Missiles, satellites, AI, and the likes put the equation upside down. Furthermore, in my opinion, we know very very little of what's happening in Ukraine. And in upper spheres. The West always makes unacceptable proposals, to Russia and to Ukraine as well. The stock of the situation: people are dying. Decisions are taken thousands of kms from Kiev, only some kind of unexpected event can change the situation. For the best or.....",1

Russia is only big in size, economically its dwarf and keeps on dwindling rapidly by its own actions

"The one issue I have towards the end about potential cold war zones, or territory concessions, is that it doesn't go into the strategic value of East Ukraine. The majority of Ukraine's industry and natural resources are in the East. Allowing Russia to hold onto what they have, one way or another, would essentially doom Ukraine economically. It would eventually lead to a Russian victory, that's why Putin is so keen on keeping what he currently has by outlasting western support.

This is the underlying reason why Kyiv considers territory concessions impossible. If the Putin regime was ousted, and the new regime was much more rational, maybe Kyiv would consider formally conceding the 2014 borders, but that's already a dream-like scenario.",0

 @jorllx The UK and many other nato powers won’t stop their support even if the US does. The sanctions won’t stop either. Whether the US does pull support remains to be seen. On the one hand it would make them look weak and could negatively impact how united the Nato bloc looks. On the other hand there seems to be a smaller appetite for supporting a free Ukraine within the US vs in Europe which is understandable as Ukraine is European.

Uneducated people talk about how weak Russia is, while they’re single-handedly holding off most of NATO and have taken just about every territory they had planned on. Most they were never interested in at all. They wanted just the few in the East, and they stated it plainly from the outset. In fact they stated they didn’t even want to have to do it at all, as long as NATO stopped courting Ukraine and it’s energy sector. Russia was previously paying $2bill to use the Eastern parts to run their energy through it to Crimea and the Black Sea. 

They weren’t giving that up to crooked Biden and other politicians!

did you see their guns at that time how antiquated they were. Wheras the Germans were building for war since the first WW. Its amazing how the Russians pushed back,1
" @ben9l351  When the Germans invaded they were no more advanced than the Soviets. In fact in many ways the Soviet were more advanced. At the start of Barbarossa the most common weapon the German infantry were outfitted with a bolt action Mauser designed in 1898 the Karabiner 98k. The Soviets had similar selection of weapon with bolt action Mosin–Nagant being the most common. If fact the Germans used far more horse drawn carts than the Soviets. The biggest difference was the quality of the officers, primarily senior officers. The Germans primary promoted by talent the Soviets purged their senior officers and installed a bunch of party hacks until Stain wisened up and gave command to Zhukov.",1
"​ @matthewhuszarik4173 Ur overestimating the Russians and underestimating the Germans

Soviet forces are not even ready for war with Germany

Germany and USSR made a pact or kind of treaty of peace 

But the Germans broke that

Soviet Union are not ready
Because of purges
Also the tanks are old and not that stronk unlike the German tanks

Soo it's more surprisingly that the Soviet forces manage to push the Germans back from Moscow all the way to Berlin even tho losing 20+ million of soldiers and civilians
Btw Germany put up around 80% of their forces in the eastern front",1
⁠ @audyprado7126 it’s not more surprising at all. Germany was fighting in the west (France) the south (northern Africa) and east( Russia) with less population than Russia.

" @ianprads9180   Only when the Germans were more engaged with the Western Allies. The war would have been over before the Soviets ever reached Berlin, providing they lasted that long without lend lease. The soldiers would have been starving too.

 @scottkrater2131  Ofc theres a farmers and theres a soldiers in a one country lol,1
 @scottkrater2131  Without lend lease the Soviet union would lose more men and far more time will pass.But in the end they still would beat the axis in the eastern front.,1

The battle in the eastern front would be more long and deadly but in the end the soviet union would prevail in a prolonging eastern war",1
" @ianprads9180   The Soviets were receiving lend lease before the Battle of Moscow was even fought. Significant numbers of tanks used by the Soviets were British. Soviet trucks were unreliable junk.

But the Soviets wouldn't have won without the US and UK.",1
" @scottkrater2131  The only thing that pushed the Germans out was the Siberian Divisions lol

Soviet trucks were junk but they are good junk food I mean they are good to transport troops",1
" @audyprado7126  No I’m not. Yes Stalin was a fool to put any trust into The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, 1939. Stalin made it infinitely worse by purging the vast majority of experienced officer corp and installing party hacks in there place. The Germans didn’t have any wonder weapons at the beginning of Barbarossa they invaded the Panzer I, II, III, and IV. They didn’t have any Panthers much less Tigers. The Russians already had the T-34 and KV1s. The Germans thought the Soviets only had T-26 and BTs but at the start of Barbarossa the Russians actually already had 1000 T-34s and 500 KV-1 tank mobilized. There are plenty of battles where the Germans lost many tanks to one KV-1. Even the vaunted 88mm could’ve take out a KV-1 at over 500 yards. Why do you think the Germans were pushed to develop the Panther the German version of the T-34 and the Tiger the German version of the KV-1? Yes the Soviets took tremendous casualties in 1941, but people frequently forget the German also took tremendous casualties. The difference is The Soviet Union had the population to replace those lost and the Germans didn’t. The Soviet Union was the third most populous nation at the time behind only China and India. Germany really had no hope of winning and if the Soviets especially Stalin weren’t so incompetent the Germans would have been crushed in 1941.",1
 @scottkrater2131  yes bro The soviets and the west needs each other that time,0
Until the end of 1942 most experts predicted a total german victory and till the beginning of 1944 they predicted a stalemate until the big soviet offensive and D-Day after that,1
 @henkschrader4513  Only a fool would have predicted a stalemate in 1944. After Stalingrad that ended in early 1943 the Germans never won another major battle. At the Casablanca Conference in 1943 the Allies decided they would accept nothing less than the axis unconditional surrender. Now that definitely doesn’t sound like anyone expected a stalemate.,1
 @henkschrader4513  I said the Germans won no significant Battle after Stalingrad. Just like the Soviet won no major battles before The Battle of Moscow. In both cases that doesn’t mean there were insignificant battles that were won. It just not one major strategic battle was won by the Germans after Stalingrad. If you look at the progress of the war after Stalingrad Germany never made another significant offensive push and never stopped they steadily advancement of the Soviets.,1
" @scottkrater2131  Most likely, the Soviets would have won regardless, as the Eastern Front for the Germans was unwinnable after the Battle of Stalingrad, before most of the aid to the USSR arrived. But Lend-Lease also certainly helped shorten the war and saved lives.",1
" @scottkrater2131  The Soviet Union and the Western Allies took different approaches to air power during the Second World War. In the West, advocates of strategic bombing and interceptors won out, and resulted in air arms which were well-equipped at striking deep into Germany.

The Soviet Union had different priorities, and preferred aircraft suited toward striking targets on the battlefield. The armored Ilyushin Il-2 ground-attack plane embodied this different concept — and the Soviets produced more than 36,000 during the war, more than any other military aircraft in history.

The Soviets were thus disappointed in the 4,700 U.S. P-39 Aircobras — although they were effective — and 3,000 British Hawker Hurricanes supplied under Lend-Lease. Far more consequential were the thousands of Western transport aircraft which bolstered the Red Army’s logistical backbone, and A-20 Havoc light bombers which contributed to Soviet offensive maneuvers.",1
 @audyprado7126   the Soviets would have won regardless is contrary to what their own leadership said. No other Allied country had nearly as many citizens collaborate with the Nazis as the Soviet Union. Approximately 2 million. And ethnic Russians made up the largest percentage.,1
" @audyprado7126   And they wouldn't have made that many T-34's if they had to a) manufacturer everything they were getting from the US. And b) had to divert manpower away from the army to supply industry to make all those trucks, trains, rail cars etc. And they didn't have the refinery capacity to make the hi test aviation gas for modern high performance aircraft engines.",1
" @audyprado7126   what does that matter? It's about 1,9 million more than the rest of the Allies put together.",1
" @scottkrater2131  Russian estimates suggest that the total population of the Soviet Union in 1941 was 195.4 million people, before it fell to 170.5 million in 1946 due to the devastation of the Second World War.
And 34million on the army",0
" @scottkrater2131  The service life of the T-34 tank continued to increase throughout the war. The engine could be expected to put out 250 hours of service by 1945, with individual drivers able to get to 300. These were not individual occurrences, as the 2nd Guards Tank Army's experience shows.",1
" @scottkrater2131  It was indeed the best tank to serve the Soviet Union. It was very easy to manufacture, mostly because it had an extremely unergonimic interior. It lacked radios and decent vision sights. Production was meant to be streamlined and the tank wasn’t supposed to have a very long life expectancy.

All of this because this is what the USSR needed! They needed to get as many tanks up and running as cheapest as possible.",1
" @scottkrater2131  What the US was sending to the UK wasn’t getting forwarded to The Soviet Union in the early part of US participation in the war. Most of what the British were sending during that period and before were British weapons. The US wasn’t sending much to Great Britain in 41 either. Of all the lend lease material sent by tonnage only 2% was sent in 41, 14% was sent in 42, 27% in 43, 36% in 44, and 21% in 45. So you can see very little got to Great Britain in 41 and nothing got to the Soviet Union either directly or through Great Britain.",1
 @scottkrater2131  it's a pity that the Soviets got to Berlin.The whole history of the world would have followed a different path.D.Patton-we slaughtered the wrong pig. (с.),0
 @audyprado7126   too bad they couldn't build them all by themselves.,0
 @ianprads9180   but they didn't. Conjecture doesn't fly over fact.,1
" @scottkrater2131  You act like it was only US industry supplying Great Britain. Sorry to tell you but Canada and the rest of the British Empire’s industry, farms, and mines were supplying Great Britain long before the US started and they were its primary source of supplies until the US joined the war and got it industry mobilized. This didn’t happen until 1943. Yes the US didn’t start out as the arsenal of democracy it grew into it. Only 17% of all US war time production was provided to allies 83% was used by the US. The US didn’t become the arsenal of democracy until WW2 was effectively over and the final outcome wasn’t in question after 1943 and the German loss at Stalingrad. 
Like I have said many times US supplies didn’t win the war, but they did keep tens of millions of allies from dying in it. Without US and British supplies The Soviet Union would have faced wide scale famine. Remember a majority of the tonnage of supplies the US and Great Britain sent the Soviet Union was food.",1
 @scottkrater2131  Not all of them don't have shoes and food lol,1
 @scottkrater2131  why too bad? It's too good bro becuz they can,1
" @audyprado7126   Russia' modern arms industry can't build state of the art weapons without Western parts. Just like the Soviets needed Western machine tools and manufacturing expertise to build their arms. For example the Mig wouldn't have been that good, without the engine they got from the British.",1
" @scottkrater2131  Without Lend-Lease … the Soviet economy would have been even more heavily burdened by the war effort,” Glantz noted.",1
" @scottkrater2131  yea about the Russians, that's why they are no buying it from the chinese lol

And bout the Britain engine?The soviets will still make it their own even without it or with it",1
 @scottkrater2131  btw the lend lease did sure helped the soviets to shorthen the war not win the war,1
 @audyprado7126   figures and facts back up my argument. Plus the words of the top Soviet war time leadership.,1

 @scottkrater2131  all of those machines that didn't even liberated the Berlin becuz the they are just a fracture on how many Soviet weapons papa Stalin had,1
" @audyprado7126   the US made more aircraft than all the rest of the waring powers put together. And they gave the Russians 2.7 million tons of hi test aviation gas to put their planes in the air. And they wouldn't have gotten to Berlin before the US had Eisenhower not forbidden it, since Berlin was in the Soviet zone of occupation. No need to take casualties for territory we'd give up soon as the war ended.",1
" @scottkrater2131  The thing is soviet union are billions kilometer away from berlin but they still manage reach it lol,the majority of fighting in the east are in soviet made vehicles,well sure they give materials and food but that just shorten the war

"​ @scottkrater2131  the US Senate 11.3 billion dollars worth of military equipment, ammunition, fuel for the trucks, tanks and fighter jets and tons of food. I don't think the Soviet Union could have defended themselves without help",1
​@ianprads9180 the United States started sending military equipment even before we entered World War ll and we started 1941 and it ended in 1945. The Soviet Union wouldn't have been able to beat back the Germans without our help. They had plenty of people but no equipment and no food.,1
"@audyprado7126  it wasn't just the military equipment, the u.s. sent 4.5 TONS of food, 1.5 million blankets and 15 million pairs of boots. If you don't eat, you can't fight. And it's hard to fight if you don't have boots. Like I said they had the people but they didn't have the equipment or the food the feed the troops. Just to give you an idea, United States sent 400,000 jeeps and trucks, 12,000 armored vehicles, 7 thousand tanks and around 11,400 aircraft.",0
 @audyprado7126  The Germans were put down by the Soviet Union. The Germans were already a beaten country before the US ever got significantly involved. Even if Germany had never invaded The Soviet Union and stayed allies. Both the Soviet Union and Germany would still have been crushed by the US. Can you imagine what B-29’s and then B-36’s raining nuclear fire down on The Soviet Union and  Germany would have done? In addition plus no material support for The Soviet Union from the West would have resulted in another Soviet famine. Germany was doomed from the moment they invaded The Soviet Union. But the coupe de grace was declaring war on the US.,0
 @Writeous0ne  You obviously have no understanding of military offensives. Assuming that because the offensive is moving slowly now it will continue to move slowly. Remember Ukraine’s primary goal is now like a Western military to minimize casualties. Offensives are fought differently when that is your goal vise using your men like cannon fodder. Ukraine can’t count on air superiority like the West has done since WW2. So their offensive will naturally go considerably slower in the beginning. They are now grinding down the Russians defenses then they will make their push. Once the Russian defenses have been sufficiently degraded to minimize Ukrainian casualties. If you want it to go faster give Ukraine air superiority and the war would be over in a couple months at most.,1
" @matthewhuszarik4173  all i hear is hope and wishful thinking. I've seen many combat clips - it is not aimed to minimize casualties.... UAF are left scratching their heads because there's basically nothing they can do except launch attacks every day.

They don't have air power (and never will - Russia have too much AA)
They don't have an element of surprise because of the drones
They no longer have an advantage in man power

All they can do is drive through minefields and attack fortified forward positions.",1

I predict that the arms deliveries will keep coming forever as this is the perfect scenario for NATO. A way to fight a war through a proxy country and Russia being unwilling to give up due to their leader's ego.  So the more they spend, the more Russia falls apart in the end.",1

Then Russians would have to commit large chunks of their army to defend this territory, Ukrainians would pull off, but Russians would be never sure if they are coming back and had to build defensive positions and keeping large amount of soldiers there... I don't know the political consequences, Putin might use it as an excuse for  dropping nuclear weapons on Ukraine, or could be viewed in Russia as a leader who is unable to defend Russian territory and there could be real coups happening in Russia, not this Prigozhin ride.... It is probably not a good idea, but from a military point of view, it makes sense, what do you think?",1

"Most wars don't really end, they morph into a different war or they fade out after a long period. WW2 was a continuation of WW1. WW1 started because of a botched treaty made after the last Russo-Turkish War. The first Russo-Turkish War started after the Russo-Kazan Wars. These started because a dude called Khan Ulugh Muhammad lost the struggle for power in the Golden Horde and decided to raid Belyov, then Vasily II,  Grand Duke of Moscow, decided to expel Ulugh Muhammad from Belyov. The Golden Horde has Mongol origins, it was founded by Batu Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan. These mofos were fighting for 800 years because of freaking Genghis Khan. Moreover, some say that the Russian Civil War can be considered a continuation of World War I, and thus all wars that involved the Soviet Union afterwards are linked to this event. WW1 is at the core of most modern conflicts.",1
"My observation is that MANY in the USA are wanting to retract aid and want Ukraine to barter and settle for some new boundaries.

" @P00009  Yes, there is different types of nukes. All types of them is still crossing the line.
If used.. I do think that it is possible that there will not be a nuclear strike in retaliation.. but only condemnation?
Wishful thinking. there is so many ways NATO could go around this. establish air control over Ukraine, the naval base in Sevastapol. 
China would definately also have negative reactions to usage of nuclear weapons..

So please do your research, before you start to talk nonsense.",1

If Ukraine did that, Russia would officially declare war and mobilise more troops and start targeting bridges and railroads in west Ukraine, to cut supply off, something that Russia still did not do.

"@DarianEX it looks that way. If I were Putin, and depending on specific delivery system, my worries here would be that Lukashenko could become nuclear power and gain independence from Kremlin. Lukashenko is a clever old fox who would eat bears lunch the moment it has no teeth.",1
 @Turvold . Not likely - Lukashenko isn’t getting directly involved in the conflict and won’t allow an offensive to be launched from his territory.  It’s more likely that he’s sheltering Prigozhin and his men from Pooty Boy’s wrath until he eventually falters so that he can gain favor with who he believes to be a contender for power in the near future.,1

Unfortunatly the neocons in America would hear nothing of that. But this war wont be allowed to ""simmer"" as some suggest as it is existential for Russia. Therefore without a negotiated settlement, the only way the war can end is with the Surrender of Ukraine.
The only question left is whether there will be any conditions to it. I am leaning more on Russia demanding an unconditional surrender.",1
Crimea is vital to Russia. Russia will never cede Crimea voluntarily.,1
@patrickhenigin4805  I mean it did in the first place.,0
"Crimea is not easy to partition- the terrain makes it hard to chop in half with most settlements in the south west and the roads cutting through the middle. Either the Ukrainians have it, or the Russians. No half half",0

 @javierdiaz7840  The US is not allowed by treaty to build a base there. Only countries on the Black Sea are allowed to station warships there.,0
" @KevinAssalin  Idk, maybe cause more than 80% of Crimeans voted to join Russia. The official result from the Autonomous Republic of Crimea was a 97 percent vote for integration of the region into the Russian Federation, with an 83 percent voter turnout, and from Sevastopol there was also a 97 percent vote for integration with Russia, with an 89 percent voter turnout.

"yes, it will most likely end with Russia occupying the territories they are right now, possibly a little bit less if Ukraine's counteroffensive is successful. Russia's occupation will probably be recognized by between 10-15 countries, while being denied by Ukraine and the West. This is how it was in the Western Sahara war, when Morocco and the Sahrawi forces agreed to a ceasefire even with Western Sahara being split",1
" @PeruvianNational  any kind i
of ceasefire though is only possible without putin in charge - ukraine won't negotiate with him and he won't negotiate with any kind of Ukrainian government that isn't completely pro-russian",1
 @twodivision  Never underestimate the probability of nuclear war as the escalation continues and there is no sign of negotiation. Washington is not interested in peace unless Ukraine gains victory and joins NATO after the war ends.,0
"I think it will end with Ukraine having to cede territory, probably under pressure from a new US president. I can see a North/South Korea style border and a frozen conflict with high tensions and occasional skirmishes remaining for several years.",1
 @thewr0ngchild  Russian' s rubles has not yet become rubbles as predicted by Washington to date. But western countries have high inflation due to this war. So Russia is not yet weakened so far.,1
"This is not Russia and Ukraine conflict. This is Russia and the United States conflict. “To weaken Russia” declared by Ukraine is as laughable as “to weaken the United States” declared by Mexico.

What would we have done with our undefeated military might in the US if Mexico, perhaps, with a lofty aspiration by another hostile global military alliance, say, CATO or Communist Alliance Treaty Organization armed Mexico to the teeth? Would we have said, “Oh well, that’s Mexico’s choice!” or, attacked Mexico in lickety-split with “Shock and Awe”?

Let’s say, Mexico despite repeated warning from the U.S. continued to receive massive weapons from the communist nations around the world. Would we have nuked Mexico just like we had done twice over Japan “to end the war” and “to save innocent lives”? 

Those without cognitive dissonance, know the answer already. 

The best course of action for Ukraine is to cut its losses and come to the negotiation table without any precondition. Forget about the lost land (about 23%). Wanting to get that land back is as wishful as Arab nations wanting to have their land back lost to Israel in 1967. 

Wake up Ukraine! We’re only using you for our weapons tests, research, sales, profits and REPEAT just like we did to many other cannon-fodder nations before you. 

Oy vey, Volodymyr Zelenskyy! Collective amnesia!",1
" @EmpireRules  are you going to educate me what is the root of this conflict? Wake up yourself, not everything is centered around the us and your country is not the cause of every conflict.

" @thewr0ngchild Nato has been on Russias border for decades and is now expanding due to their aggression. This war has got nothing to do with Russia being scared of Nato and everything to do with Putin’s nationalist worldview. He sees Ukraine as Russian, some blood and soil type belief.",0
" @mimiwinarto9164  I suppose, if war criminal Putin dropped a nuke, somebody else might be inclined to slide one across the table to Ukraine. Things happen. But it'll be up to Ukraine, if they still want to join NATO after the war. Personally, I'd let them in now.",0
 @mimiwinarto9164  . I agree with you on that. Other’s opinion can also be right,1
"I am curious. Do you feel like most ukranians would be willing to give up Crimea (only Crimea) to end the conflict? Of course with Putin in power it seems impossible to negotiate. But still, would be great to get your view on that scenario.",1

There is no winner in war maybe by land but people die on both sides so victory does not exit in a war sorry for bad english,0
I would love to hear from a ukranian why zelensky would not let the eastern states leave the Ukraine. They legally voted to leave the Ukraine so why would zelensky want to keep people that didn't even want to be there.,1
" @EmpireRules  Russia is losing this war, badly, they just havent broken yet. Its mostly an artillery war and the western artillery has been totally dominating Russian artillery. Soviet technology is simply inferior. Western counterbattery computers are far superior. Western reconaissance image recognition is far suprior. Russia is losing 3 to 4 artillery systems for ever ysystem ukraine is losing, and the US has barely scraped the surface in terms of artillery systems we have in storage. Russia started this war with several times the artillery Ukraine has, now its about even and Ukraine has a slight artillery advantage in the south. We see the russians relying more and more on mortars and ww2 era systems. ITs obvious how finite russias supply is, they have lost over 5,000 pieces. At this rate, Russian artillery will likely be nonexistant within a year. ITs becoming more and ,more obvious how hopeless this war is for Russia. They have over a quarter million casualties. Masses of Russian young men being sent to their deaths in ukraine, by their government, in vain. They are all dying for absolutely nothing as Russia cant win",1
 @mimiwinarto9164  so in the end Okraine will become much more richer country than Ruzzia?,1
" @mimiwinarto9164  not true. Rubble suffered great inflation as pointed out even by chief propagandist in Ruzzia. The ruzzian banks were forced to manipulate currency before by using reserves and stopping people from trading currency via law. However this can't be kept forever as seen now.

Also high inflation in west? I live in Finland, our prices haven't changed at all since covid. XD
Ruzkie coping hard here.",1
" @twodivision  Most Westerners have a hard time following Russian logic, it's borderline crazy. Say, Ukraine would've become neutral, meaning Russian. Then Russia would've had NATO on its borders anyway-Slovakia, Poland, Romania, not to mention that these countries joined NATO out of fear from Russia. So how would that have been any different than having Ukraine in NATO? On the other hand Russia's biggest problem wouldn't have been Ukraine joining NATO, but EU because that would've meant losing the age-old battle for controlling Europe to Germany. The Soviet/Russian Union collapsed while everyone is rushing towards Germany. Germany learnt that you get further with honey, than with a stick... which Russia still didn't realize...",0
"Update on the conflict in Ukraine for August 9, 2023: 

- Western analysts and media sources are beginning to admit the poor progress, heavy losses, and fundamental flaws of the Ukrainian offensive and beyond that, the unsustainable nature of the proxy war in the first place; 

- Ukraine is shifting away from attempts to storm Russian lines and attempting instead to conduct attritional warfare, however, it lacks the material resources to do so which necessitated “storming” tactics in the first place; 

- As Ukraine’s offensive falters on the battlefield, Kiev and its Western sponsors have been focusing on aerial and naval drone strikes to create the illusion Ukraine maintains the initiative; 

- Quantities of artillery, armor, and trained manpower determine the duration of Ukraine’s offensive. The disposition of both Ukrainian and Russian forces including the reserves of both sides will determine if a breakthrough will occur; 

- Russian military industrial capacity and the material resources it produces for the ongoing military operation ensures that no matter where Ukraine’s offensive ends on the battlefield, it will leave Ukrainian forces exhausted, depleted, and unable to sustain their fighting capacity; 

- Industrial capability between the collective West and both Russia and China is and will remain into the foreseeable future leaning in favor of Russia and China; 

- The West gambled and lost on “small wars” as it enters an end game for geopolitical unipolarity against Russia and China and the reality that modern warfare against peer and near-peer competitors requires industrial capacity the West doesn’t have and cannot obtain;

Ukraine's Offensive Remains Stalled: Western Media Begins Admitting Failures",0
" @nickvickers3486  if we assume Russia has been losing the war, as people say here, then why would they later invade again if a negotiated peace settlement they were happy with at the time was made?
Maybe if Russia was actually far more successful militarily than we think then it might make sense if they knew they could take more land again with minimal cost and losses. But is that the reality?",1
" @nickvickers3486  I think you also have to look at the incentives honestly. And the history. Would Russia invade a NATO country? Well clearly they’re trying hard not to. And NATO is also tiptoeing around trying to not cross a line to start ww3 as well. This is obviously deliberate on all sides. And recall the USSR included many of these countries that are now NATO. And understand that nato exists purely as an anti Russian military alliance from Russia’s perspective. The entire point, the way they see it, is to intimidate and potentially attack Russia. Who else is NATO against really? Not many others. And the progression of NATO easterly towards Russian borders closer and closer over time, taking over their former allies in the USSR is of course threatening. Russia hadn’t been spending the last couple decades spreading influence westerly and installing weapons on borders in new countries closer and closer to NATO as part of an anti western military alliance, so that has been a one sided escalation for the most part for the majority of that time, from their perspective. It’s easy from our side to be like pfft we would never attack. But from their side they’d say “well we aren’t attacking you, so why are you escalating and moving weapons closer and closer to our borders??” Which makes sense. They moved missiles closer to Russia each time. Remember the Cuban missile crisis? Having missiles close to your border causes that kind of panic. We know from that experience that it would have the same effect on America as it has with Russia. And if u recall, even that installation of missiles in Cuba was actually in retaliation for missiles installed close to Russia in Europe. So Russia learned from that experience that complaining falls on deaf ears and only military action gets listened to. Which is still true. I don’t know why. It would have in retrospect made a lot of sense to negotiate missile positions and neutralities well in advance of this war such that this war wasn’t necessary. 

But yes, Russia retaking the USSR is a ridiculous false explanation of what’s happening. It’s certainly never going to be a thing for many many reasons. 

We had mutually assured destruction keeping us from ww3 (still do thankfully) and the balance of military power worked well to maintain leave without anyone escalating, and nuclear weapons were gradually being reduced over time. Then for some reason we decided to escalate NATO and shift the balance. A clear mistake and it was unnecessary. Why can’t we just leave the balance right in the sweet spot and make sure nobody escalates at all, so we can then let things simmer down and instead try to become friends and then gradually disarm",1

That would require military force of at least 3 millions surrounding Moscow.

"I don't think that either.. voluntarely.
However.. economics..
Russia had their main income from oil and gas before. Biggest customers? US and EU. Sure, China and India can offset some of that, but lets be honest.. they got great deals.. for them.
Also.. war is EXPENSIVE!! 
So.. decrease income, increase expenditure.. Sure, Russia had reserves.. but they aren't limitless.
And at a point.. they will run out.
What happens then? Printing of money. How did that turn out for Mugabe in Zimbabwe?",1
" @Brandofviti  Nice analysis! I think everyone in the West underestimated Russia's reserves, but they definitely are NOT limitless... even with their current level of sanction evasion, they are not able to make up for the huge losses they are taking daily. Same thing about the export: China and India can surely buy some oil and gas, but not at the same levels and, above all, at the same prices as UE and USA did...",1
" @axios101  actually. I think they could buy it for the same price as us if they wanted to. But why should they?
Both China and India isnt unintelligent. They know that they due to the sanctions cat get it dirt cheap. Why on earth should they not?
Quantity? Completely in agreement. And well.. closing and opening oil wells is hardly like flipping a switch.
 I believe Russias economy will be hit hard once the reserves run dry",0

Yes.. They do have pipelines to Asia.. How much capasity is there in those as compared to the ones going to Europe.
Yes, pipelines are being built. How long does that take?

So my point still stands, Russia and Japan are still technically at war, even though it has been ice cold since 1945... Likewise the Sakhalin Islands are still disputed territory. To be fair though there have been several attempts at a diplomatic resolution for the Sakhalin Islands, all of which have failed, and I guess both Russian and Japanese leaderships forgot they technically haven't ended WW2 yet.",0

"They don't have a ""Peace Treaty"" but declared a formal end to the state of war and declared the beggining of peace and friendly relations between the two countries, the name of the treaty was not ""Peace Treaty""  but was a treaty were they declared peace.

Using nuclear weapons, even during a war, is still frowned upon by the entire international community and is 1 of the only actions that will actually cause massive consequences against whoever uses them. There's a reason why Russia, despite all its failures in Ukraine thus far, has yet to push their red button and use their nuclear arsenal despite constantly threatening to do just that.

Winds would be completely different in Siberia and the radiation would stay on the west of the Urals because it would not be able to past the mountains.

Absolutely no evidence to back up your claim,0
 @michaeldunham3385  Really?  Ukrainian Ambassador to Australia confirmed such three weeks ago and there’s thousands of hits on google confirming the issue.  The evidence on your claim is what?,1
" @seanlander9321  from just 6 days ago....... Casting doubt over a proposal to supply Ukraine with retired fighter jets, Australia on Thursday said the matter was “complicated"". Kyiv earlier requested dozens of retired F-18 fighter jets from Canberra, saying it would significantly boost its air power against the Russian forces.",0
" @michaeldunham3385  Oh, so you actually came up with something?  Since November Australia has approached Ukraine. Not a single thing done by Ukraine in 8 months, which is time wasted that could have gone on flight and maintenance training.  Instead they’re dreaming about F16’s.",0
" @nibson3217  Nope.  Australia put the idea to Ukraine in November, even held up the sale of the planes back  to America.  The Americans have given approval to transfer the planes to Ukraine provided that Ukraine first asks for them, which it hasn’t.  These are seriously upgraded planes, Canada recently purchased 25 of them for $500.0M to plug their capability gap in NATO.",0
"Because they can't fly them and it would take a couple of years of training to get them to a point where they even have a small chance of performing at a level required for modern aerial combat against veteran foes flying planes they have been trained on for years.

It's lucky for Australia they weren't sent because they would all have been burning wrecks on the Ukriane steppes by now.",1

" @michaeldunham3385  You’ve come up with nothing.  Ukraine’s own media confirm that they have only just asked to know the condition of the planes, spares and training equipment.  Ukraine gambled instead on getting F16s, and it didn’t work and that is months of flight and maintenance training on a perfectly decent airforce lost in what now amounts to a double blow.  The same planes are good enough for Canada in NATO but not good enough for Ukraine, and it wants to be in NATO.  What a stuff up.",1
" @seanlander9321 
They would have been a big threat against any Russian 4th or 4th+ aircraft and ground targets considering their very good radar capability and the different ordinance available to use on that platform. Also would handle the rough strips if needed.",1
"War is not simple, neither logistics, is not simple as getting handed f18s, that’s why the current f16 program took so long",0
" @FishandHunt  Exactly, which is part of the reason people are scratching their heads about the indifference from Ukraine.  Additionally, Australia doesn’t give two hoots about Russian threats to supply Ukraine with fighters and it would probably also give the Europeans a spine if they saw another country step in where they are too timid.",1

" @user-iz7fu2dp6q  Media has long confirmed a few Ukrainians have started F16 training.  But, there’s no training of maintenance and no deal to supply the jets either.
I said Ukraine had done nothing to engage with Australia since last year to provide it with 40 FA18s, training, training equipment and spares.  There’s no other readymade airforce  of fighters available anywhere else, so it seems more than odd to ignore for so long what is needed.",1
" @seanlander9321  
% 
We'd have experienced Ukrainian pilots trained up and in the fight within 6-8 months. 40 of these aircraft are a formidable amount of AirPower.",1
" @FishandHunt  Yep, so what’s the holdup with Ukraine?  More than six months has been wasted, and that’s time that also could have gone into training the maintenance crew.",1
 @moonasha  Why would Ukraine spend money on something that might not happen?  There’s no training at all for F16 maintenance by Ukrainians which is going to make it impossible for them  to operate F16s.,0
 @3rdeye671  Really?  Which NATO country or countries will maintain the maybe-to-be-donated F16s?  Because if that’s the case then those maintenance crews won’t be stationed in Ukraine.,1
 @seanlander9321 you probably don’t have all the information regarding any deals between Ukraine and Australia or any other country,0
"Yeah. Russia has access to about 120 jets most of which would be either in par or superior to the old F-18s sp 40 F18s would just be a place to lose valuable pilots

The F-18s might be useful if at least 120 gripens were able to be put into service at the same time to balance the number field, but I don't think a jet that old will be worth the trouble it would take to train on it if we don't serously pledge to immediately send more modern American jets once they prove their feet are wet",1
"From what I'm ready there's less then 40 actually combat ready, but most of them are expected to be able to be brought back to life pretty quick

It's just not enough as is we have to litterally triple the offer for it to mean anything, and for it mean anything worth while we need to scrounge up a fresher jet",1
" @WhatHappenedIn-vt3vq  The FA18s are not just fighters, they’re ground attack, which is kind of needed atm.  Anyway the upgrades to these planes and the thousands of hours of flight time left on them is better than nothing, as well as being a stepping stone to quicker training for the  F16.  Canada  satisfied its NATO capabilities by recently buying 25 of the planes from Australia for $500.0M, which means that they and NATO are satisfied with the capability against Russia’s planes.",1
" @WhatHappenedIn-vt3vq  They’re combat ready planes.  The advantage is that they come with spares, training and training equipment for a degree of Ukrainian autonomy, and there’s no offer like that anywhere else.  Agreed though 40 planes isn’t enough but no one else has put anything on the table anywhere.",1
Because it was a false offer by the Aussies ...............allowed to make the offer but not allowed to follow through. Hands tied,0

" @greycliffnative  Your point of view is essentially head in the sand, that no news is allowed unless it’s good news.  Australia is ready willing and able to provide Ukraine with a sovereign fighter airforce.  No other country has that capacity or is ready to do the same.  Yet Ukraine seems instead to be holding out for F16s, and that’s a very long time away, if ever.  Meanwhile, if Ukraine had extracted the digit, it would have had a set of capable fighters by now and also an example to other countries to step up to the crease instead of talking about donating jet fighters.
BTW, shooting the messenger is the tactic of the Kremlin.",1
" @carsten8850  The US has already given approval, subject to Ukraine requesting the planes.  The issue is that Ukraine has NOT made any request, except for a very recent inquiry about what condition the aircraft are in.  The Canadians jumped at the chance for 25 of these planes from the RAAF, they’re more than impressed and have used them to plug their capability gap in NATO.",1
"I can give you fine, with a stretch, but realistic? Are you high? Also they have a lot of old missiles, it would be wasteful not to use them, the nuclear capability was not touched. Those notions come usually from countries like UK as projection as they do not expect anyone to have hundreds times more weapons/missiles then they do. It is funny as UK does not have any capability to produce nuclear weapons or their carriers and is fully dependent on US. Also do not understand why the western commentators always mention the made up idiotic notion that Russia wants or would nuke Ukraine, Russia would never nuke its own territory. They would not have problem to nuke NATO country though.",1

"It is more like the American Civil War than the Revolutionary War - except that in this civil war Russia is supporting one side, while USA/NATO is supporting the other.  Do not forget that the Kyiv regime could have avoided this war if it had been willing to abide by the Minsk agreements. Russia did not claim any territory beyond Crimea, whose population overwhelmingly identified as Russian, and who declared their independence from Ukraine at the same time Ukraine separated from USSR - unfortunately unsuccessfully at that time.",1
"How is this similar ? American continent is thousand miles away from UK mainland (island), Russia is next to ukraine.
What a dumb comparison.",0
"​ @tibomoltini2851 you mean Ukraine vs Russia, because it were Russian troops there all along, like they were in Crimea, putin himself said that numerous times. And no, there was no continuous fighting for 8 years, most of the battles happenned in 2014-2015, after that a stalemate was achieved with little casualties. All of the civilians who died because of the conflict after 2015 and before 2022 died because of the mining done in 2014-2015, on both sides. And yes, there were some ceasefire breaches, but they were exception and not the rule. So no, full-scale fighting happenned for 2 years only. 

And a small military conflict involving several thousands on both sides is not the same as a full-scale war with army mobilisation and shelling of the entire country. If we think about the 2014-2022 conflict, it didn't involve nearly as many resources, so it could be dragged on and on. This 2022-2023 war, on the other hand, can't go on how it's now for a long time. Militaries on both sides are exhausted, Russia doesn't have that many missiles left. The best option for Russia would be to re-create something similar to 2015-2022 situation, where there is a war, but there aren't many resources involved. But this requires Russia to stop spending on the military defense, which they cannot allow themselves to do, since Ukraine has added up the resources sent from the West and just waits for a moment of weakness at Russian defense line. 

So what we're looking at now is something like this: on the one side, we have a limited number of people with a what seems to be a never-ending flow of weapons and machinery, and on the other side, we have a what seems to be a never-ending flow of people with a limited number of weapons and machinery. Both are very important. Something will break first: either Ukrainian military people who are exhausted or exhausted Russian weaponry sources. Only time will tell.",1

"All I gotta say is that this is Russia’s Vietnam. They invaded Afghanistan and occupied it, but these type of casualties and the fact that thier opposition is being supplied by countries that Russian is not allowed to invade, just kind of speaks to the quagmire that was similar to Vietnam. Russia attempted to train and advise Ukrainian rebels to fight against thier own country.  Russia got impatient and decided to commit conventional forces instead of the limited combat advisors and support to the separatists. doesn’t that sound familiar?  Pretty sure us Americans made the same mistake in another country.",1
"Since the spring counter offensive its not so clear that Ukraine is winning. The issue is they are attacking reinforced Russian positions, without superior numbers or air superiority. And you can guess how going through a minefield while artillery is shooting at you goes. Because Russia is hitting Ukrainian cities every once a while, Ukraine is forced to keep a lot of their air deference away from the front line, which does not help. Russia also learned since the beginning of the war, and their military seems less incompetent, than at the beginning. I think the most likely outcome is a frozen conflict.",1
"I think Putin is buying for time, waiting on the new US president in 2024, hoping it is Trump, or any other another candidate who is likely to be more lenient towards Russia. This would mean Putin can then try to negotiate a settlement in his favour. The 2024 US elections are very important to Russia, as US elections always have been. This would also give Putin the chance to demand Western sanctions are lifted as part of any negotiations or deals struck with the US and Ukraine.",1
"This is EXACTLY what I was saying since February 2022! I even compared the war in Ukraine with the conflict between Israel and Palestine and proved why these wars NEVER really end. The reason is sadly one thing that these videos will never tell you - because they have agendas and are 'sponsored' - is that the war is not supposed to end according to the military and politicians otherwise they would lose trillions of dollars they are making off the collapse of the economy and the constant change of power they can control most of the time in war zones. Making peace means losing jobs for the military and losing influence for politicians buying property for almost zero money during conflict. 

Poor people fight the rich men's war since the beginning of time and they are still doing it today which proves there is no real progress on this planet in the last 2000 years despite technological innovation. It is tragic for those who are attached by ego and their habits but liberating for those who live for the truth and are spiritually free. So this conflict is in fact a global test for each of us individually because puts in perspective everything we know about life by reminding us we represent hundreds of generations living before which are breathing through our cells.",0
Tough call on how this war would end. Hopefully Ukraine will prevail ,0
"I don't see any acknowledgment in here of one of Russia's main points: keeping NATO away from being next door to Russian territory. Not sure how you would propose a peace treaty without addressing that in some way. The closest this cartoon comes to that is suggesting that Russia will in fact accept Ukraine joining NATO so long as it keeps control of some territory. It's possible they'll be forced to, but it's not a position they're likely to agree to.",0
"Russia has a better supply here. More soldiers, better weapons.",1

"What? Ukraine has a far smaller army and military force.
They pushed back the Russian in the west and north. They took back a lot of territory in the east.
Russia recently had to deal with a military coup. NATO is pledging further support to Ukraine.
How is Ukraine not winning at the moment?",0
"​ @taserrr  Russia isn't losing, that much is certain.  You even said that Ukraine has a far smaller army and that's because they have the disadvantage of having a much lower population.  They have nowhere near the population of Russia, therefore Russia can more easily replace troops and build up a large ground force which is what they've been doing while Ukraine struggles to advance.  Ukraine has western technology but they're also burning through it fast to make very minimal gains.  

Also that coup you're talking about amounted to very little in the end.  If that's such a big deal, why hasn't Putin been overthrown yet? More importantly why has Russia barely lost ground during the counter offensive?  

Lastly, were you aware that Russia has recruited 180,000 additional troops since the start of the year?  They're also figuring out how to bypass western sanctions and are now trading with other countries, most notably China.",1
" @taserrr  Those successes are als oUkraine's problems. THey did so well a year ago everyone now expects a repeat, and it isnt happening. Russian's are dug in, fighting against NATO tactics lacking key NATO elements: air support. Further pledged support means nothing when you need things now. The West lacks the inventory, production and functional items to maintain their support to Ukraine in the long term. Ammo, shells and advanced weapons are all in limited supply and manufacture. The coup has amounted to nothing, except maybe rooting out potential traitors. I dont see Ukraine as winning, as it is losing more than it holds. Losing more men, weapons, soon terrioty a (TBA). It's military is smaller, but was about the same size, if not larger at the begining of the conflict, as the US had been training them since 2014 to grow and enlarge their forces. Ruskies went in with was was available and not called up.Both sides have grown their forces hard, but both, have burned loads in Bakmut over the last 10 months, and now Ukraine has fewer high end forces compared to what it had. Russia can hold with poorer troops given they are on defence. Russia has gone to a near total war footing, with far more weapons, munitions and output supporitng their forces, hence the new assault in the north east. 

The greater issue the war will have is the longer it lasts, the less democratic and totalitarian the Zelensky government will become. Massives signs of this are showing all over the place. Ukrainian graft is still a huge issue, and fighting it, maintianing western enthusiasm, fighting against total war Russia, the attrition game is not in their favour. Western superweapons will only get them so far. Logistics, numbers, material and moral will tell the final story here.",1
I agree with you Peter. I think only one that can stop this is Ukraine citizen if they shake down their goverment. As long as US fuel this its not gonna stop,0
" @sweeneytodd011  Obviously if you had any knowledge about the current frontline.
It's mined with millions of mines, that's right, millions. They're protected by artillery and 3 defensive lines.
It will take weeks if not months to clear a path, at which point they'll be able to push through.
But they need more pushing power, and probably some diversions. 
Cutting of the Russian supply has been pretty successful as they rely so heavily on train supplies which comes through a single bridge which has been partially blown up by a Ukrainian missile strike.",1
"​ @mikem2949  Russias excess population is irrelevant, the limiting factor is heavy equipment, not men to fight. One armored behicle will easily win against a thousand infantrymen. One infantryman with an atgm can take out an armored vehicle but the limiting factor is the number of atgms, not men.

Russias problem is that they ahve become almost entirely an extraction state, and their industry has collapsed. The US and Europe have 30 times the industrial capacity Russia does. Western artillery is decisively superior to russias, and this is mostly an artillery war. Russia loses 3 to 4 artillery systems for every one artillery system ukraine loses. Western counterbattery fire and reconaissance visual recognition is vastly superior to Russias, as well as range of most systems. Russia has already lost over 5,000 systems and at this rate they will mostly be destroyed within a year. Its obvious how hopeless this war is for russia",1
"@timothywoodard8766        We've heard this before.  According to pro war advocates (mostly Democrats at this point in the US), Russia should have already collapsed.  Some people are still caught up in the whole mindset that Russias military underperformed when they invaded.  That's old news, the question now should be... How are they maintaining a sizable ground force in Ukraine when, according to some, this should have been over by now?  You're saying Russias industry has collapsed yet they're still fighting this war.  That makes no sense and is an oversimplification of what's happening.

In my opinion, this is history repeating itself.  Ukraine is, without a doubt, reliant on western aid, the bulk of which is coming from the US as usual.  But America doesn't have nearly as much interest in fighting this war as Ukraine and Russia.  The same was true in the Middle East and in Vietnam.  What was happening during the war in Vietnam was of most concern to the Vietnamese, obviously and eventually, the US withdrew due to political pressure and the war continued without us. 

 You can say that this situation is different because America doesn't have boots on the ground in Ukraine, and you'd be right, but that doesn't change the dynamics of America's involvement in foreign wars. When public support for a war diminishes, it's only a matter of time before our politicians decide our involvement isn't worth it and in case you're unaware, public support for fighting this proxy war with Russia is already diminishing. So technically, Russia just needs to maintain a presence in Ukraine and wait for the US to lose interest again.

Beyond that, you're wrong that having a larger population is irrelevant.  You're right that having heavy machinery is important for sure, but manpower is absolutely important to both Russia and especially Ukraine.

A larger population means more ability to produce military supplies and equipment, and sure Russia produces far less than Euope and the US.  That's a consequence of their communist and authoritarian government, but 
Russia still produces far more than Ukraine, and as I said before, US support for this war isn't indefinite. 

A larger military also means there's  more eyeballs on a ground level to raise awareness to advances being made by the opposing army.  Not everything can be accomplished with spy satellites, you need men on the ground for maximum situational awareness.

On the other hand, a very low population can have consequences as well.  When a skilled fighter in Ukraine dies, there's a much smaller supply of replacements to choose from.

This should be common sense, and also keep in mind that Western media is prone to exaggerate gains made by the Ukrainians and downplay or ignore losses.  So Russia isn't the only nation guilty in that department.

The truth is somewhere in between, neither Ukraine or Russia are making the kinds of advancements needed to win this war decisively.  However, if that remains the case, then Russia has already come out of this with new territory under their control.

I don't want that to happen but don't think Ukraine is particularly great either.  They have a highly corrupt government, and ultimately, I think Democrats are obsessed with this war because they're obsessed with Putin.  They aren't really considering the consequences of the actions that the U.S. has taken.  There's a lot more to consider than whether or not Russia withdrawals from Ukraine, which seems unlikely at this point anyway without negotiations.",1
" @mikem2949  As for how likely it is the Russia will withdraw from ukraine, again this is mostly an artillery war and Russia losses, due to superior western artillery systems, are unsustainable when Russia lacks Soviet style production and can only produce about as many artillery systems in a month as they can lose in a day, at most by this time next year Russian firepower will be so depleted they will be forced out. The estimates are they had about 10,000 systems, and have already lost over 5,000, and are losing an average of 20 to 25 a day, many times higher than Ukraine is. You can already see the consequences of this, as ukraine has a slight artillery advantage in the south, about equal overall, when russia used to have a several fold artillery advantage. It looks very unlikely russia can sustain this. Most wars of this scale lasted several years, just because russia hasnt broken yet doesnt mean they aren't heading there. Why should Ukraine sacrifice more people and equipment then they have to by going all out in their offensive, when Russian heavy equipment is being attritted so badly? Europe and the US are both well on their way to scaling up ammunition production to a million shells a year each, and russia stupidly blew most of the stockpile the first year (this is when they gained most of the ground they did) and the west is just now tapping into their cold war stockpiles (cluster munitions) when the russians have been using theirs for a while.",1

Even if it is just Wagner that could launch this attack are their enough Ukrainian defenders to stop such a flanking maneuver, and if the majority of the regular people's response to the Wagner protest showing most think  they are out of the war wouldn't it make sense for Russia and Wagner to stage that uprising to pull off this maneuver by artificial creating the element of surprise.

It’s not a far fetched idea. In fact it makes sense to flank from the north with war on the eastern front. However the majority of Ukrainian forces are not in the east. In fact 70% of troops are ready to defend Kiev.

Russia as a country has unlimited resources of cheap energy (oil and gas), they have rich resources of iron and other metals, they have their own steel mills and military industry. Their industrial facilities are well out of reach from the frontline and the infrastructure is fully intact. They can just keep going at it.

"This video isn't very objective because it's not looking at the facts on the ground. The Russians did miscalculate by sending in 180,000 men to invade Ukraine, but when they realised the war was going to drag out they changed from an Offensive to a Defensive Posture. So while the world was holding its breath waiting for the outcome of the battle for Bakhmut with some Russian mercenaries, the rest of the Russian army dug into strategic positions, with 400,000 men entrenched in a 10 to 20 miles deep defensive complex. The old Soviet Doctrine had always assumed that USSR/Russia could never gain air superiority against the NATO, so instead they've always invested in a reasonably competent air-force and state of the art surface to air missile system to deny NATO the command of the air. By doing so they calculated that it would take air-power more or less out of the equation. In 2023 we can safely say that the Russians are reverting to that doctrine because the Russian Air-Force is largely intact and uncommitted because their mission wasn't combat ground support but to attack any hostile aircraft - and Ukraine does not have an effective air force. The Soviets then planned to replace tactical air support with massive artillery support - they spent years accumulating an arsenal of artillery assets that outgunned the combined NATO artillery firepower by a factor of 10 or more. NATO had gone the other way, investing in quality rather than quantity, deploying ever more advanced precision missiles and combat aircraft. As of today, the Russians are firing anywhere from 30,000 up to 60,000 shells a day at Ukraine, while Ukraine can hardly muster 15,000 shells a day. The NATO 155mm shell production capacity is at approximately 5000 shells a day, and they have been buying from S.Korea, Japan and Singapore to keep up with the Russian rate of fire...and still the Russians outgun Ukraine more than 4:1.  This is a scale down because when the Russians were on the offensive at the outset of the war, they were firing 200,000 shells a day - but that fell to 60,000 shells a day when they switched from Offensive to Defensive - but that still dwarfs Ukrainian firepower. Therefore it has become a war of Quantity vs Quality, no different from how they used their cheap and rugged T-34s and artillery against the superior German tanks in WW2. As of July 2023, the Ukrainian counter-offensive against Russia has stalled without even reaching the main Russian defences, simply because it could not fire enough expensive Himars or Storm Shadow missiles to compensate for its deficiency in artillery firepower. So, no, the Russians are not going to lose any time. The Americans are beginning to realise this and they are beginning to talk about it in their Main Stream Media. The presence of 500 Leopards, M1-A2s or Challengers won't make a difference if they can't even reach the main Russian defences. Don't forget the US pounded Iraq for a whole month before the ground forces moved in - the Russians are not Iraq, Ukraine isn't the Kuwaiti desert and the Ukrainians don't have the entire US air-force at its disposal. The politicians and press in the UK can mouth off their fantasy of defeating Russia - the facts on the ground show a completely different story.",1

"Many great points, but I'm still worried for the Ukraine:
1) their industry and mining are either occupied or destroyed. They lost most of their harbours, and the fields won't be worked anytime soon. That along with tremendous damage and human losses makes me wonder how long they can keep up the game of attrition.  
2) Many military supplies are becoming short and not just in the Ukraine, but e.g. Germany. Plus, the people are against further involvement for the most part! It may get even worse this winter if Europeans have less energy and lower temperatures than last year...",1
My idea is that most of the West don't want Ukraine to actually win but rather want to bleed Russia (and also Ukraine) hence they supply Ukraine stuff that are great for defense and limited offense but aren't enough for a grand offensive.,1
"There's two thing I have to say:

1) Ukraine will not push Russia back, Russia will lose because they will physically run out of equipment.

Russian artillery is already half of what it was at the beginning of the war. And it is entirely possible that Russia would only have 4000 pieces left that could be used, that's a years worth of artillery, tanks will last two more years, and APC's will last 3-4 more. If Ukraine holds until 2025, or 2026, the war will be over for Russia.

2) You cannot negotiate a genocide 

Ukraine will die if they lose, the Soviets were in the same position in WW2, and the only reason we aren't speaking German is because of Western aid to them, and their refusal to make peace

If Ukraine holds for two more years, the war is over. Russia will be forced to pull back.",1
Putin is not seeking an exit.  He's waiting for the West to grow tired and disinterested.  He's counting on it.  He knows the Western democracies need to negotiate with their people and their internal opponents and he does not.  It now seems like many in the West are so foolish to let that strategy work.  It will come back to bite anyone who is that short-sighted or self-interested to allow that to happen.,1

" @TechieWidget  this seems easily likely to me. their GDP has fallen through the floor, millions have left the country probably permanently. And the amount of damage done on a daily basis to the country is significant. And the cost of the weapons, ammo, equipment etc used daily is also significant, although generally given for free by NATO countries (I’m not 100% certain if some of it is based on loans). Assuming the war ends at some point a few years from now, the country will be economically in ruins as well as physically in ruins. So even more people will migrate away and very few will want to migrate back. Meaning even less economic activity to help fund the rebuilding of the nation. And depending on the outcomes they might also be funding ongoing a huge military costing a significant portion of their gdp as well. Prior to this war they had the largest military in Europe outside of Russia in terms of personnel. I can’t see that getting smaller. 

With that in mind, you’d think the sooner they can end the war the better. The additional damage done to the country done if the war stretches out a few more years will probably never be able to be recovered",1

" @rhino015  The majority of ukranian refugees have already returned to Ukraine. IT was mostly women and children that left, and they will return to be reunited with their husbands/fathers.

Ukrainians are very family oriented. Also the social benefits for them in europe will expire, and most will not be allowed to compete with locals for jobs, so that will push them to return as well.

Most of all though this invasion has given ukraine far more unity and patriotism then it ever had before. Just like Europe came back stronger after WW2 so will Ukraine. You already see their tech sector booming from prewar levels,a s well as private manufacturing of things like drones. Ukraines industry has alreadh rebounded, its remarkable how reslieint the ukrainian economy has been.

In some ways this war has made ukraine far far stronger, they have a far stronger identity then they did before, they will no longer tolerate corruption, while russia, a cluntry that is already rated significantly higher in terms of corruption then ukraine, will continue to be crippled by it",1

Below is a quote from a Ukrainian  research on the issue. The information of the research has been  used in a Bloomberg article.

""According to our calculations, as of the end of June 2023, 5.6- 6.7 million Ukrainians are abroad because of the war. This is 0.3-0.5 million more than the estimates presented in the preliminary version of this report(as of the end of 2022, their number was 5.3-6.2 million people).

According to our calculations, between 1.3 million and 3.3 million Ukrainians may remain abroad under various scenarios. This is 0.4-0.6 million more individuals than we estimated in December 2022. This change is the result of the prolonged duration of war and the continued adaptation of refugees to life abroad. The non-return of Ukrainians will significantly impact the Ukrainian economy, which could lose between 2.7% and 6.9% of GDP annually.""",1

Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czechia, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania and Bulgaria never asked their citizens on the subject. The membership was decided by a handful of people at the top.

Telling Ukraine it can’t have long range missiles because it’s not allowed to launch long range strikes is basically the same as telling the US it wasn’t allowed to invade the Middle East after 9/11 Ukraine has the right to defend itself properly and Russia has not been shy about attacking civilian targets with long range missiles. Those missiles would be used to hit Russia where it hurts in their supply lines and reserves….

Zelensky is now deeply unpopular and likely to be deposed by coup in the near future.   I suspect that's why he's been kept in Washington over the last few days.  Russia, by comparison, has actually gained from the sanctions against it.  Oil prices have been forced up and it's raking in dough by selling it eastwards.  Putin also has to watch his back but it has to be said that he's probably in a stronger position now than he was before he invaded.

Thirdly, you don’t talk about how Ukraine is 100% reliable on others for the same weapons in munitions and they’re running low on magicians and they’re not using their own weapons, so they don’t really know how to use them. If we’re being honest, there’s only one way for this to end Ukraine will lose. It’s just how much they lose.",1

Russia is playing the long game obviously. They aren’t trying to advance as fast as possible. They are picking off Ukrainian troops. Ukraines air force is gone so it’s very difficult to advance and Russia has more artillery and bullets. That is why Ukraine’s offensive has been a total fail. Once Ukraine is so depleted Russia will start to move in and put them in a chokehold.,0

"The intellectual property of the arguments for Russia's special operation lies with Germany. If you consider yourself decent, you can read about it in the Potsdam Memorandum.

" @paolosantiago3163 

Ukraine has super weapons and STILL can’t make any progress. Do y’all want Spider-Man and Superman too? It would be smart but Ukraine would still find a way to get them killed in combat like all the tanks they lost trying to do an offensive push. Big fail that was",0
"Sadly, ""the west"" no longer includes the US. Congress decide to keep the government open, and let Ukraine depend on Europe for defense.",0
"5 months after this video was posted, Russian troops are advancing between 500m/day on average on the current frontline. There seems to be a massive issue emerging in Ukraine regarding the forced recruitment of troops, generally bad for morale of the troops. Seems like Russia will take this all the way to Kiev and afterwards there won't be a Ukraine left, perhaps a neutral zone in Lviv. One NATO provides long-range missiles to Ukraine (after the recent attack on Belgorod), Russia could potentially strike airfields in Romania and Poland, and NATO wouldn't do a thing about it. The war is over, Ukraine has lost...but the US has an investment in this war, one worth several billions and they want their money's worth...which means to drag this out as long as possible, but the war is already lost for Ukraine",0
How wrong he was. I predicted Russia would win from the start,1
"Even if Russia defeats the Ukrainian army, they don't have enough soldiers to occupy Ukraine against its extremely hostile population. I doubt Russia can defeat the Ukrainian army even if NATO aid slows. Slow NATO aid would doom Ukraine to a stalemate though.",0
And we Europeans are tired of giving OUR money to Ukraine instead of using it to solve OUR problems,0
"Is 500 meters a day on the border of 1300 km? one meter for every kilometer? This costs hundreds of lives of Russian soldiers per day. I think they will run out of soldiers before they reach Kyiv. I also think that Russia is afraid to strike NATO.
So far it is clear that the forces of the parties are equal. Ukraine and Russia can continue the war on debt and the front line may not move.",0
" @aki_me_  No, advancements are only on particular sections of the frontlines. For example yesterday they took from Ukrainians area 230x300 meters in Georgievka direction. Russia surely will not run out of soldiers. They daily loses are counted in dozens, while they daily receiving 1000+ requests to join russian army. Even if they accept just half of them, its allowing them to comfortly fill battle loses and creating new units. On the oposit side, Ukraine daily loses are around 800 men. Monthly they losing between 20-30 thousends men. Since october, they are not able to fill even battle loses by mobilization because there is simply not enough men left for further mobilization. And thats the core of russian strategy. They dont really need some big advancements and territorial gains, they measure their success (daily/weekly/monthly) in amounts of destroyed members of ukrainian army. Soon or later, territory itself will fall to them as side effect of collaps of ukrainian army. Ukraine now sending at the frontlines previously heavily injured men, preparing mandatory mobilization of women and teenagers. In other words, ukrainian army falling apart as its nearly bleeded out. Cripples and women are terrible soldiers and will never be able to effectively stand against growing russian army, not even speaking about what further effects on Ukraine will have mobilization and destruction of her women population (its already have lowest population growth ratio on the world, without certain amount of women, that statistic parameter can just canceled). Ukraine losing and ukrainian army is beyond its pinnacle point and there are no more mobilization reserves and together with that also will of west to pump her up with money and weapons as everybody see its pointless.",0
" @aki_me_  I'd describe it as trench warfare, so 500-800m per day is significant. The tone highlighted in Russian media also focuses more on men killed than territory gained, since the main objective is 'demilitarization'. The Russian DoD considers 200 losses per day acceptable, but they likely have less at the moment, while on the other side we should look at an estimate of 800. Ukraine will eventually run out of troops, many they are sending to the front now are not fit to fight. Yes I think Russia has been careful. They have not even attacked air-defense systems of Ukraine that have been embedded in civilian neighborhoods and that would be the next step, but if the west truly decides to send long-range missiles and if F-16 continue to take off from Poland/Romania to strike targets (particularly in Russia) then those airfields will eventually become a legitimate target for them, without NATO getting further involved.",1

Oh and this ridiculous background music is just straight up horribly distracting and very unprofessional.  Evidently someone doesn’t know how to produce a basic video that allows its viewers to EASILY AND CLEARLY hearing the audio that’s meant to be heard………..   what a common amateur youtube mistake,0
"When this all started, I said to my extended family members (we were all on vacation in Florida at the time) Russia has only one objective, and that is to establish the land bridge to Crimea. That's what they've accomplished, and the attack on Kyiv was just a feint. Now the ultimate question is whether that result is accepted. Russia would be ecstatic with that result, because it was Putin's original aim. The other possibility is a return to the borders before Russia attacked, but this would require Russia giving up the entire reason they embarked on this, which would be a huge humiliation. Still, Russia is pathetically incompetent and corrupt, so it's possible that they will run out of cannon fodder and if the west keeps supplying Ukraine (money laundering aside), they may be forced into a very bad choice. I think Putin will use tactical nukes before that happens, and then the question will be what the west is willing to do in response. I suspect Russia getting the land bridge and keeping Crimea would be the result, with Ukraine admitted to NATO and given nukes of its own, with Russia being a pariah state similar to North Korea and completely shut out of all dealings with the west. China would abandon them as it wouldn't be in their interest to be on the side of using nukes relative to business dealings with the west. Iran and North Korea might end up being their only allies. Russia then might dwindle to being a Venezuela like state or there'd be a revolution or coup that would seek to get Russia admitted back to the community of nations.",0

"Aside from context. Because it was Russia that decided to invade, regardless of the reasoning, I've always felt that Ukraine as a sovereign state has the right to defend its internationally recognized border. However the reality seems to be more and more that Russia has already won. Especially now that things have started in Israel aswell. I hear there's people that say Europe and the US don't have enough munition and equipment left to send to Ukraine and Ukraine can't maintain proper manpower and good soldiers the longer the war goes on. A problem Russia in comparison at this point does not yet have. Plus Russia is manufacturing munitions alot faster than their western counterparts are doing at this point. I hope I'm wrong about this, but I don't think I am. If the stalemate persist, the best option will probably be for them to redraw the borders along more easily defendable and clear lines that are rivers, hills etc. And no ceasefire bs. Just a full on peacedeal.",1
"Really? One of the first things in this war called timidly ""Special Military Operation"" was a complete defeat of the ""second"" strong army in the world near Kiev and north of it - have you seen videos with hundreds and hundreds of destroyed Russian tanks, armored vehicles, trucks, and thousands of dead soldiers? It was before the Ukrainian mobilization. Did you forget how Ukrainians kicked the Russians from Kharkov oblast in the summer of 2022! And the nation in war under a heave assault from a superior adversary needs to mobilize soldiers - what have the Russians been doing since 2022 Fall mobilization? Every month rounding thousands of its men and sending them to the trenches. Not counting tens and tens of thousands of criminals sent directly from the prisons to the front to die. Be honest and objective, if you can, Russian sympathizer.",1

A small part of Ukraine ...WE ARE taking about a land mass  is almost 200,000 sq km  
In EU terms thats the  size of  Belgium, Holland, luxembourg and Greece  all put together..

In UK terms that the size of  all of Scotland , Wales and 80% of England all put together !!  

In US terms is the size of South Carolina, West Virginia and New Jersey all put together !!     

Why the f. should Ukraine give Russia  all that land for what? TO ONLY  be invaded  some years later when Russia as had a brake and regrouped ,rebuilt  its army and fortified positions  !! 

I SAY RUSSIA GETS TO TAKE LAND AND DEMAND UKRAINE CAN NOT JOIN NATO IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AT ALL !! Nobody wants to be a ""buffer country"".   NO nation wants to have a little bit of  freedom  !!!!  ;  The whole concept is demeaning to an independent nation. NO nation wants to have a little bit of  freedom  and self-determination, like some sort of 2nd class country; That is not right, and Russia has no right to demand  or  bully  Ukrainians or Ukraine to accept that Ukraine and its ppl. should become  some sort of lap dog on a leash  2nd class country to serve kremlins geopolitical agenda;  so Kremlin, Putin and RuZZans can feel better about themselves ...


---------It is embarrassing that the US and Europe do not support Ukraine more than they do , the US. were in Afghanistan for 20 years and achieved less than Ukraine in 2 years, and Ukraine  is also a much stronger opponent with many more resources !!  As a Norwegian  I am ashamed of our policies in the west , the western nations governments use every opportunity to go on national TV and tell how much they support, but the truth is that we have only provided 94 Euros per inhabitant, it is ridiculous when we look at the size of Ukraine, the opponent and the way Russia has bombed cities in Ukraine back to the Stone Age, and that we (western nations )  have not lost a single person in the war , we are talking about Europe, democracy and freedom that Ukraine is defending , one can only be ashamed

Eastern European countries (ex soviet countries like Poland the baltic states ect ect ..)   joined  NATO because they are scared of Russia and want to be and stay independent. Nobody forced them to join NATO they was the ones running and knocking and begging to be able to join NATO and the EU ,,, .

When Russia invaded Ukraine Russia then  just showed why it was a good idea for those countries to join NATO, because if they didn't they might just have got invaded as well just like Ukraine and Georgia did . 

During Soviet times those Eastern European countries were nothing less than Russia puppet states. If they didn't join NATO after the fall of the USSR then they for sure couldn't guarantee their own independence from Russia. 

Nato did nothing wrong, the only mistake was Ukraine not joining  NATO to ensure Ukraines   independence; Remember  former satellite states like Poland, Romania, Czech Republic and The Baltic states, Slovakia ect ect all came running by their own accord, knocking, kicking, screaming and banging at the front door of EU and NATO begging to come in, no one forced them into it .S",1

Russia may leave this war much weaker, but i still think it can ""win"" the war of attrition the moment US stop cutting investment on ukraine.

"11:00 - The problem with Crimea giving Russia access to the Black Sea is going to be a nonfactor because the Ukrainians have been using British anti-ship missiles with incredible range and jamming technology and have destroyed over 1/3rd of Russia's Black Sea Fleet's major ships. Apparently such weapons can fly low to the ground and avoid detection until the last possible minute, and is capable of calculating it's own flight path, meaning Ukrainian pilots just need to activate the missile and release it rather than have highly sophisticated communication between the projectile and the plane.

F-16s would dramatically increase the effectiveness and number of sorties the Ukrainians can launch against the Black Sea Fleet, even if there's only a handful of them. Once the F-16s start flying, the Black Sea Fleet will dissolve. They'll be capable of launching anti-ship missiles from much further and if they can access NATO radar data, much more frequently and accurately without concerns on being intercepted.

Without the Black Sea Fleet, there is little, strategically military point in controlling Crimea, and nothing would be protecting the Russian assets in the Black Sea from... well, anything. Maybe not a nail-in-the-coffin, but that would force a ton of redirected concentration of Russian forces and fall backs.",1

It is interesting that the West has this in its war strategy with Russia, but does not want to allow it to the Ukrainians. Ostensibly so that the conflict would not escalate. As if it hadn't already escalated so much that the only thing left was to drop a nuclear bomb. The West is quite hypocritical and indecisive in world politics, and that is why it is losing the positions it had before the collapse of the USSR.",1

I think it was a reasonable/sensible offer from Putin to end this war.

Those areas occupied, de facto, now by Russia are populated by Russians for centuries. Ukranians got those areas in their state, along with many areas with Hungarians and Poles. Ukranians were oppresing those Russians for years and even decades. They wanted to stay Russians, but Ukranians wanted to convert or expell them. They rebelled and startes uprising 2014, when a low frequency war started. Ukranians wanted to eradicate them with help of USA and NATO, but before that Russia strike with invasion. They defended its own people. Russians 'kidnapped Ukranian children' ? They moved they own children to safety in Russia. West is decaying hard. You think your lies matter, but they dont.

"Honesty today, is something we see little of, and whether intentional dishonesty, or misguided beliefs, there's never any excuse to see what we all really have seen from the American people themselves. 

Every democratic society has a responsibility to keep their own government under control, no excuses. The Americans need to understand that no matter where anyone's loyalty may lie, we NEVER support wrong over right, but should always be more than willing and prepared to stand up and fight for, right, over wrong! The Americans completely misunderstand this truth today, and it's driving us all to Nuclear war... 

Americans really do believe, that supporting your own country (no matter what), is the patriotic thing to do! Really, quite unbelievably, this is exactly what these people really think today. Only, that's so far from patriotism, It's not even close, but it is the complete opposite of patriotism, It's treason, and It's outright treachery. 

So why are they all being traitors against themselves? It can only be because they don't know what patriotism really is! 

To the rest of the world, when, and if you ever found out that your own country is doing things it shouldn't against other countries and their people, like breaking International law, and like committing criminal acts of murder and terrorism, then being (100% against) your country and government, is known as being patriotic! And even more patriotic than it is if proudly supporting and praising your country, for maybe doing something good, something helpful, or something right. 

Because if you have ever found out that your own government is doing wrongs to other countries and their people, to then support it, or to ignore it, or even worse, to deny it?, is committing treason against your own country! 

No patriot would ever support his own country if he'd found out his country was doing wrongs to others in the world, because doing so would be, in effect, exactly the same as him supporting the corruption, supporting the terrorism, supporting the brutal murder of innocent people, and supporting his own government breaking International law! 

And that would be no different from supporting his very own country's demise! And that's known as treachery! Not patriotism! And that enormous mistake they continue to make, also comes down to morals, ethics, and a reasonable education. 

We all must understand right from wrong, above all else, right?. We should also understand the importance of truth, right? And the truth really is, that there's only one major thing at fault, so guess what it is? It is, entirely, and without any doubt whatsoever 100%, the American people themselves who are all at fault!  

And when I say ""all Americans"", I mean all! I'm not tarnishing anything, or anyone, I am only speaking the truth. If not all Americans, then please do show us any American standing up against this, and demanding it stops? And I say this with every right, and with every damn reason, (least of which is, it's only the truth). 

The truth is, that in 2015, Russia exposed the US government (to the American people), and to the entire world, for supporting terrorists in Syria! And that forced the US government, (to admit to the American people) and the whole world, that they had recruited — trained — armed — supplied — protected — paid — and used, brutal terrorists, the “Free Syria Army”, in Syria, (sorry, the Americans use the term ""moderate head chopping so-called rebels"", it's only terrorists to the rest of this world, pardon me, my mistake). 

Yet not a single one of the Americans have ever condemned it, not one has done the right thing, and stood up against it, or even protested against it, demanding it stops, (as every other society on earth, would be doing, if any of our governments were forced to admit what the USA admitted). 

We'd all be out on the streets in the millions, bringing our countries to a standstill, if any of our governments had admitted what the US government has, right? So, It just seems today that these Americans must feel that's below them all, or something just as cowardly, self-righteous and ignorant, I guess, those lives, just don't matter? 

In fact, let's just the truth, far from seeing anyone of them protest against it? What is the reality, what have we really seen, from any of them, (since they all found that out)?? 

We've seen millions of them cheering their criminal presidents, and we've seen millions of them chanting USA USA USA, (just like the Nazi's of the 30s). And we have never seen a single American, stand up against it, let alone start demanding it stops, why not? 

2018... Teresa May announces British strikes on Syria, within 3 hours, literally hundreds of thousands of people are stood outside Parliament protesting against it. 
2018, Emmanuel Macron announces French strikes on Syria, later that evening in Paris, hundreds of thousands of people are protesting against it. 
2015, Russia exposes the USA to the American people and the entire world for supporting and supplying terrorists in Syria, and still, 9 years later, man! Not one American has even condemned it, let alone stood up and protested against it! 

They don't even know, let alone understand, that the only society we've ever seen do this before, throughout modern history, (a society not even bother to stand up and protest against their own government's admitted criminal murder and killing of innocent people) once the people found out, was indeed, Nazi Germany 1933-1945! 

That's the only time in modern history the people of any society, have done (or not done), what these American people are today. 

This is just another truth, another truth, that seems to be forgotten today, but what was the most asked question after WW2, a question asked all the way into the early 1980s? 

""Why did the German people do nothing""? 

What's worse, is, we can understand today, why the German people did what they did, they were starving to death with the harshness of the Versailles treaty, and dying in large numbers during the great depression, so quite naturally, they'd of supported absolutely anything that offered them hope! 

These Americans have absolutely no such excuse. This is the biggest problem facing all of us all today, it is the biggest problem the rest of us have ever faced in our lifetimes! 

So, I wonder why this is so clear to me, but seemingly so few others? In fact, I'd be fascinated to hear a European or Brit tell us who they think is going to pay for these self-righteous American fools refusal to do a thing about it?  

Will it be all the Americans paying for their own lack of morals, their own lack of ethics, their own stupidity, that sees them, once again, swallowing dangerous, yet remedial propaganda, and outright deliberate lies? Or will it actually be the Europeans and British, well? WHO? 

The Americans clearly, and without any doubt at all, have no morals, and as for any kind of understanding of ethics?, you're joking, they'd all need to look up what ethics are! 

Truth will always come out, and it must always come out, and must always be said, and that truth today is, it's these American people themselves, who are all, 100% at fault and responsible for all of this today. Obviously because it's up to all of them to stand up and start demanding their government stops all of this! 

Nobody else can do that, only they can! - But the huge problem we all have, and we all face today, is, that none of these uneducated, and extremely cowardly fools and clowns will do a thing. Get it yet? 

Basic principles, ffs!! Principles like, the (people) of any society, only ever need to remember that the easiest way to figure out the right from the wrong? (in any likely oncoming or future war scenario), is to just ask yourself what you'd be fighting for? 

Because it's the answer to that question, that should always be showing you whose right, and whose wrong. 

For example, if the American just asked themselves, that if, the USA went to war today, against either Russia or China? What would they all be fighting for? Then ask themselves what the Russians or the Chinese would be fighting for? 

They'd come to find, that both the Russians and the Chinese would be fighting for their own freedom, and fighting for their own country's freedom! While the Americans would only be fighting for attempted American global tyranny, (and that's no different from Nazi Tyranny). How Ironic! - That's what they're all, in effect, supporting today, and if they really can't see that?, well, all I can say to that, is, the Nazis were just like that, they all claimed they couldn't see it either! 

The Americans will all be seen by history, as the Axis powers, trying for American Tyranny over the rest of the world. While the Russians, the Chinese, and much of the rest of this world, will all be seen by history as the allied powers, fighting against this clear attempted American tyranny, and fighting for their own freedom. 

Make of that what you will, but again, it's just more of that good old thing known as truth, honesty, and the reality. It really is the United Nazi States of Global Terrorism, America  -  Enemy of the world.",1

"I really appreciate seeing both of you present at least the outline of the true history of post-wwii Korea, something long overdue in the west. I will say, though, that I didn't hear anyone say that the original division of Korea into Russian and US zones was intended as a guide to military operations against Japan. The US did not send troops to South Korea until after the Japanese surrender, and then they simply kept the Japanese occupation in place and gave its top functionaries orders. When this caused insurrection in the south, the US installed an administration of Koreans who had collaborated with the Japanese occupation, and made many of the Japanese officials into an 'advisory council.' Foreign occupation was supposed to end in 1949 after several years of a jointly supervised period in which the whole peninsula would have one elected government, but the US suppressed the nationwide elections in its zone and held its own elections. These elections were largely boycotted, and there were mass protests and a general strike following. My grandfather was a minister in the Rhee government in the south. He was an ardent anti-communist, but he told me clearly that if not for US shennanigans the whole country would be united with a democratically elected government- but the dominant party would be the Communists, so suppressing democracy was the only choice. Of course, he was a yangban, the scion of a family of landowners in the north, who lands were nationalized and redistributed by the communists so...
It's also not clear to me that there was ever a time when there was no US military presence in South Korea once they finally showed up. The US occupation began in 1945 and continues to this day.",1

" @peterlindberg1678  Nobody is denying that it took a long time for IDF to react on the 7/10 to what was happening, but as far as warnings go, I would guess they come in quite frequently. How all the weapons were smuggled into Gaza (from Egypt, as it seems) is another question. When it comes to the moniker that “Israel created Hamas”, that is completely disingenuous. At one point a cleric whom Israel thought they could communicate with, was sponsored. He later became radicalised and was one of the  founders of Hamas. Just a little reminder, not many years ago, Israel traded ONE soldier against 1000 Palestinian prisoners, in a swap. Are you for real thinking that Netanyahu (I’m not a fan by the way) was instrumental to the biggest massacre of Jews since the 2nd world war???",1

 @peterlindberg1678  my answer was taken away as often happens if you are leaning pro Israel. Go figure. Check out what the leader of Hamas said the other day regarding the sanctity of life. Do you know what Hamas is about?,0
" @peterlindberg1678  No, I do not, but one thing, what do you think Israel should have done after 7/10? It is easy to be kumbaja and wish peace for the world.",1
" @TheBeautifulWindsofAragon  is it easy ""to be kumbaja and wish peace upon the world""? That is not what I find when I look at the world.. If it was that easy we might not have any problems ☝️

There are lots of problems in a world infested with economic structures inherited from a colonial world, cultural and religious dogmas and less than successful means of communication camps in between.. 

Israel/palestine is in the heart of the center of much of this, and sadly Israel is serving as a military base of the us (in a very wide sense) 

No, I don't have any solution, if any that would be to create an open source/free speech/user owned social media platform.. 

Communication is key, unless we let wars dictate. 

Most central I believe is to see what really is governing the world; Money; and to see what that really boils down to; Dept.

The more we communicate, the less the ignorence, the less we are guided by fear. Let me be naive and wish for more people to wish for peace and be kumbaja (whatever that means)

Of course I don't have the answer, but the more you see 7/10 as an isolated incident, the worse

I am fully aware that this answer might sound a little ""too kumbaja"" for you, but let me finish by saying; try to avoid corporate news, be very careful not to limit yourself to information of which you already believe, and make sure to listen to those who possess intellectual honesty and curiosity, and avoid those who hide behind labels and ""teams""

To finish this off I really would like to recommend "" Dept. The 5000 first years"" by David Graeber

It is not easy to wish for peace, to try to acknowledge that most people come from a good place but are struggling to see that place as a very limited perspective 

But my real answer would be; Amnesty, the cancellation of all Dept (and crime/punishment) That is how they used to fix the inbalances in the world in ancient times (& why interest is banned in all religions (as I understand it)

Peace",1
" @peterlindberg1678  Peace on you too, but how do you communicate with someone that wishes you dead?",0

Good of you Joe. Thank God that America has some people who are intelligent and have the heart at the right place,1
Mitch McConnell and Mike Johnson should look up the laws surrounding us military aid and how legally the US should have already stopped offensive aid to Israel the moment we knew they were using our weapons to commit potential war crimes,1

Free the hostages.,1
I don't want to hear them anymore. They are lying and lying. It makes me miserable.,0
Has anyone written a book listing all the times Linsey has blatantly flipped on topics depending on who’s pulling his strings?  He has no shame. Actually that seems to be the theme for the whole GOP.,0
He doesn’t think we’re stupid. He thinks we're weak. And he’s right because our judicial system is weak.,0
This is the male version of MTG ....  Lindsey is king of the flip flop universe. If you want to know which way the wind is blowing just ask Miss Lindsey. Netanyahu has to go now !!! Trump and Netanyahu are one and the same. Excellent Lindsey impersonation Mr Joe !!! Jim and Tammy Fay Baker revisited !!! It's shake and bake and I Helped daddy !!! ,1
"""First of all, try some sunscreen buddy."" I never scrolled back so fast in my life",1
In my opinion Joe Mr Graham does exactly think we are that stupid because in my opinion also he is,0
"Exactly! It was never going to be a perfect evacuation,but we got out relatively unscathed.",1
" @sharonharris9782  To be fair, I don't think anyone expected the collapse to happen so quickly.  I think the DoD expected the Afghan forces to at least put up a token resistance.  What did it take, 2 days for the Afghan army to evaporate and the government to flee?",1
I read a great statement the other day. “You don’t put 80% of a fire out”,1
The hypocrisy of Graham after the GOP held up military aid for so long to Israel and our other allies and he has the gall to say any of this is shameful.  Besides we are supplying them with defense.  Offense is a different matter. Politics is starting to sicken me in ways it never has before.,0
It looks like he done had a few just ridiculous,0
His base is really that ignorant...next question.,0

Absolutely,1
"​ @amyreynolds3619 again, Graham has been elected 4x in a row now. Therefore more people are voting for him than against him. Consistently.

Yeah they are  hypocritical they were against anything that Israel and other countries needed and now they're saying don't do this ,0
The Hiroshima/Nagasaki comparison is ridiculous.,0
lindsay is irrelevant.,0

Yes, yes they do. And we're just letting them, soooo",0

Miss Lindsay must own a lot of stock in defense contractors,1
Lindsay Graham drank the koolaid and  lost his soul a long time ago -,0

Not EVERYONE HAS TO BE MARRIED.  THIS IS IRRELAVENT,1

The flabby adulterer must have some really incriminating evidence against Lindsay,1
They were free Oct. 6th,1
Don't light a match around Lindsey.,1
South Carolina deserves better than Graham. Lindsey also stated he didn't care about Poland.  Poland is in the United Nations and the US has a military base there. Who is he supporting?,0
Lindsey Graham lost his manhood a long time ago...I cannot understand how these ppl are so scared & willing to wreck their careers for a fool,1
No just knows his party will buy and are that stupid,0
Its because its 2024  and election year. That senate is unpredictable!,0
Why is it that that country doesn't have a military. Most countries do just in case something like this happens. The United States always have to supply them with what they need to protect themselves. What other countries are giving help. Haven't heard of anyone else.,1
Both sides are wrong and they are both pitiful,0
Why doesn't bibi want to negotiate so they can end this war already?  There has got to be concessions on both sides...that's just common sense!,0
"Does he fight like that for the American people. Help your people, AIPAC did not elect you the American people have elected you in case you forget.",0
He's right.,1
The question I would ask Graham is why is Israel fight more important than Ukraine or Taiwan,1
"Long on Betamax? Big mistake, should've gone long on the greatest in-home movie entertainment provider, Blockbuster.",1
"Why are the Republicans angry about getting out of Afghanistan when it was their ""Dear Leader"" who first promised that he was going to withdraw troops?",0
Good question.  Japan attacked us at Pearl Harbor because we would not let them seize Manchuria.  How is Ukraine or Taiwan different than Manchuria?,1
"Hate to break it to you, buy ‘yes’. And there’s a reason why.",0
"Hamas started it. This isn't a hockey game, but if two players want to fight, sometimes the referees stand back and let them go.",0
"Why Lindsey boy is barking, jumping up and down in his seat?   Is he upset that his boss is going to be found guilty in NY court by the end of this month?",0
Lindsay Graham needs to find a good man and retire he's totally backed up,1
Joe is expressing what so many of us are feeling.,1
Can someone provide Lindsey with 10 children and a robotic wife lol,1
This guy is a genuine creep,1
Yull think two big armies are fighting each other,0
"The good news is, Lindsey can hide his own Easter eggs.",1
"Lindsey needs a midnight visit from his late friend John McCain, perhaps he can take him for a stroll down John McCain Street in Ukraine and give him a talk about how very badly wrong a turn he took, when he started praising and bowing to Trump.",0
"Interesting how delaying support for Israel is a travesty, but delaying support to Ukraine for months is fiscally responsible.",1
Isn’t America in support of Israel defense. If that’s the case they shouldn’t be sending them offensive weapons. They funny need those for defense,1
"Lindsay should go home
We have enough wise guys",1
"I’ve just decided I like Joe!
Way to rant on a topic that needs some serious airtime, Joe. It’s time to make America aware of just why most of the terrorist attacks against the U.S. can be blamed directly on the horrible behavior of Israels putrid, greedy and corrupt leadership!!! President Biden is absolutely right in his decisions regarding weapons for Israel, and he is the first president to finally start to save the world by putting Israel in line! He’s got my vote!",0
"Was he not the same man that boldly said count me out of January 6th, 2021, and only for him to support Trump the next day. ",1
i always was aware of lindsay being a cowerd but now i also think he is a traitor...,1
Senator Cotton's remarks the other day were Constitutionally treasonous.,0
Lindsey is all about who pays more.,1
Wouldn't it be great if these GOP politicians were this outraged when their caucus refused to approve aid to Ukraine to stem the Russian onslaught?,0
Does Lindsay have a drinking problem?  Definitely an explanation for his behavior other than senility!,0
Lindsey and the Republicans are full of it.,1
JUst Evil,0
"He should spend some time focusing on Boeing! They moved to South Caroljna so they would face regulation. Now they have parts falling off of aircraft, while in flight. Also, 3 whistleblower engineers have denied in the last few months.",0
Lindsay graham should be charged with discriminatory remarks because he is a lawyer before then is a lawmaker in the congress he mean what he saying and what he is saying should be changed with a criminal charges,0
Lindsey needs to go to jail,0
"I don't necessarily like Lindsey. However there was a hold out of money and supplies because we want fix our own border. Which by the way,is still open",1
I loathe that guy- Lindsay - what a fake-,0
"Two things, Lindsay! 
Number one you and your comrades have been sitting on this legislation for months and that is the reason not what the president did or did not do! 
Point two I know it is a shock, but President Biden is the president of the United States and not that of Israel️️ 
✔️OTE, y’all. Because your lives are worth it.",1
Lapdog Lindsay doesn't have opinions of his own. He just does what he's told.,1
I SEE EVIL IN LINDSEY'S EYES.....,0
For the first time Lindsey Graham is telling the truth,1
"Wishy Washy Graham spends minutes tossing out questions like an angry 7 year old girl, and then doesn't give the respondent any time to respond.  Instead, Graham answers his own questions.  Graham is as bad as Jordan, MTG, Gaetz and Hawley, when it comes to asking questions.  They're all bullies, with zero sense of fair play.  Disgusting.",0
Seems like 55xwajt outinbti sicceed so they both can be in charge and split things up disgusting,0
Lindsay who? Completely irrelevant.,0
"Graham is such a spineless excuse for a human, he has no right to yell at anyone.",0
Joe keeps it real with facts.,1
Pathetic to compare Israel to Hiroshima ,0
The people on this program as so mixed up it's sad. America is done.,0
If Graham thought it was such a bad idea to get out of Afghanistan why did he let Trump sign an agreement with the Taliban.,0
He’s more like a Lindsay Lohan than a Graham. The jelly baby is searching for a man to make him happy. Nothing you’ll send to Israel will make any difference. The determination of the Palestinians to free their country is priceless.,1
"Wow. Joe is actually showing some common sense. He can't ignore the truth, that everyone else sees. He wants to be on the right of history,  when this sll shakes out.",1
Lindsey has descended to public clown level with his fake indignity hissy fits.,0
"In fairness....
Between Betamax, and VHS...the Sony Betamax was the better machine....

VHS became more popular, because it was marketed less expensive...more people were able to afford those units 

Sorry Joe ....your Dad was right.",1
"Ah yes, ceasing to supply targetting equipment will definitely help

And then you'll complain about then using less precise strikes, which kills more civilians...which will be entirely your fault",1
Ms Lindsey is going to bring on a stroke if she isn't careful ,0
Graham is insane,0
"Mr.Graham doesn't think that we all are that stupid. He thinks that you, Morning Joe, are stupid. And I cannot agree more. And this is from the mouth of a lifelong Democrat and a perpetual listener of Morning Joe.",0
Lindsey Graham needs to go to jail with Donald Trump so they can sleep together,0
"Graham is always crying about one thing or another.  South Carolina, please elect someone who isn't feckless. Graham thinks we are stupid. He also thinks that we think him and Scott are straight.",1
I hate Netanyahu.,0
Mrs Lindsey (wimpy) South Carolinas example of a manly man. Too funny ,1
"But, the poolboy likes it long and luxurious.",0
"Yet they had no problem with democratic Ukraine being invaded by a neighbor and having to militarily defend themselves. Instead, they claim that putin should be allowed to annex huge portions of Ukraine, if not all of it.",1
Maybe little LG is upset because his Memaw gave him such a stupid haircut! ,0
Ms. Graham is a joke.  Like most of that party....,1
Would Senator Miss Linsey be so adament angry and vocal about his republican colleagues refusing to supply Support and arms to Ukraine. WHY do Republicans want to Support Putin??,0
Does anyone think MSLSD is NOT stupid?? ,1
Lindsey Graham is about to cry again little baby,0
">> Does he really think we're that stupid?

Yes.  And ""we"" are that stupid.  When ""we"" means the MAGA crowd.",0
Biden is essentially Mr. Too Little and Too Late!,0
Grams Is so full of crap His fake outrage is sickening,0
"R honourable J Biden is a very decent,right thinking man.",1
"Stupidity, us the montra of the Republican party!!!",0
little warmonger shouldn't have a platform.,0
"YES, he does think everybody is just that stupid as  This is is the same man after all who thought NOBODY was smart enough to remember much less know how to work the audio/video equipment to review Lindsey's blatant lie about allowing voters to pick the next SC Justice in an election year but oh how Lindsey's stance did a 180 when he recognized an immediate benefit. 
Lindsey is also the same guy who thought we should've set a permanent base in  Iraq & Afghanistan and never ever leave. 
In fact, Lindsey has said & done so many stupid things, even his own voters have started to wonder, who's really earned the stupid label in this equation...? Nope, it's definitely Lindsey.",0
Trump has something on all these guys that hated him before he got elected ,0
"I would vote Republican over this now, never thinking i would do such a thing. However i wont.because of Trump..I wonder how much influence Ireland has on Biden. We know where that country stands. Biden is in error here. He needs to listen to Republicans now. Is Graham correct now? Forget his being wrong on the past. Rigjt is right.whemever it happens... Also there needs to be a modicum of pushback on any nedia presentation. Not this display.",0
35000 Palestinians have been killed. What about that?,0
Lindsey Graham is a little weasel.,0
"That was Graham's blindfolds and cigarettes speech for the Palestinians... Graham is using the exact language ofthe Israeli Rabbis and Military members. The closes Graham got to military armed combat was JAG courtrooms. Here, babies are dying due to power stoppages, children burned, lost limbs, starving and near death. How nonchalant his humanitarian comments must be.",1
Like Miss Lindsey gives a crap about Jews?,0

As the Gentiles refused to keep God in their knowledge, they committed crimes against reason and against their own welfare, and God gave them over.  ",1
Is Lindsay Graham an alcoholic? He's got those vibes...,0
"Lindsay knows that Trump made a deal with the Taliban to get out of Afghanistan, but he wasn't strong enough to fully leave so he just reduced the force to 2,500 soldiers who couldn't maintain defense of the military base there.",0
Is Lindsey Graham representing Isreal or American citizens who are protesting against Genocide. Who are these congress working for? Does America have any strategic importance by wasting our tax money for Isreal. It's questionable why Congress is kneeling for Isreal. What's Americans benefits.,0
"You sound desperate, Lindsay. What are you hiding?",0
No matter how much faux outrage Lindsey puts on Trump will never ditch Melania for him.,1
FJB WORST ADMINISTRATION EVER,0
"Graham thinks that MAGA is that stupid, and he’s correct.",0
"So Graham basically tells the truth, and you guys can’t handle it like adults, interesting",1
"The right wing base is that stupid, yes.",0
Pres Biden is a little late better late than never,0
Watching Joe show I about lost it listening to Graham blame Biden for months of show boating by the GOP.  If you are in the GOP you have to follow the talking points of Trumps little Red Book.  Deb Fisher NE R said word for word the same thing as Grahm. Give me Break.   When you have no other agenda than lying you have to lie.,0
"Lindsey ""brown noser"" Graham is as honest as ""Moscow Matgorie"".",1

"100 percent correct. Think about all the gadgets we have right now and understand our military is at least 70 years more advanced than what we can see, touch, and use all in the name of national security. But what if we did spend all that black budget money on things like clean reusable energy, food and housing for all the homeless in this country, advancements in agriculture and peacful social behavioral classes for all including those in government and law enforcement. Imagine if we could all get along without HAVING TO NEED NUCLEAR DETERANTS. The creation of those weapons was a huge mistake and every county with them should make an agreement to destroy the whole lot of them. But you know what do we know right? Why should we spend billions exploring and maintaining our worlds oceans or spending to figure out how to send people into deep space when we can just spend it on building a bigger death device. I don't think that in this day and age of technology we need to have a BIGGER STICK than the other guys what we need is to learn how to come together and talk through our differences so as to better serve the people that give these assholes the power they hold.

How right you are my friend. When they come out of their Nuclear Bunkers where do they think they will go. What will they eat and can you see his advisors military men leaving their families to suffer whilst they are safe on their bunkers. If Mr Putin thinks The Kremin will still be standing he is dillussional as will the white house and downing street will be gone. Have our world leaders thought about that I wonder.

Well, let me tell you the difference. The Russians have the best Missile defence systems in the world . They have the S500 and S550 specifically to shot down hypersonic missiles which the west don't even have. If the nukes work, they would be on the lowest level of hypersonic. 
The Russians  Avangard glide vehicle  go up to 20 times the speed of sound and carries up to 20warheads . So my brother, before you can reach your obsolete trident missile in Germany, Brussels , UK, Italy  and others , You will get an assured strike of atleast 2nukes on you. This is not a Joke. Stop deluding yourselves. 
Russia itself say s its the destruction of civilization. It recognised that some nukes would brameak through its defences and all it takes is just a few.  America would not even get its aircraft carriers near the theatre before they are annihilated for your information, why? Because Russians possess  the Khinjal , the Zercon tm. They are hypersonic. America is still falling at her attempt to get an operational one. They can go up to 3,000 miles to hit their target bro. Now think about that",1

Americans know very well what it takes to use nuclear for Russia. Their protocol calls for 7 layers before they are used it is not like American protocol the president orders and pentagon execute.

They know DJT will be too old by that time and he’d have been inactive from politics so long, he could never theoretically be considered for a position of such high office.

You still get the Today programme, etc., inviting MAGA Republicans and Trumpists on to talk about whatever, and the presenters generally treat them as if they're run-of-the-mill everyday spokespersons or politicians.  It's infuriating, because it's not just Trump who's out to destroy US democracy, it's the entire MAGA movement, which is made up of extreme right-wing fascists (of which Trump himself is one) and Christian nationalists.  You'll often hear MAGA folks say the ""US is a federal republic"" as a (ridiculous) argument in denial of the country's democracy.  So, they're all in on destroying America's democracy, not just Trump.  So to say we're in a extremely dangerous situation if Trump gets elected would be an understatement.  Personally, I can't see how the world, let alone the US, will be able to survive another Trump administration, politically, environmentally, economically, and apocalyptically.

As much as people hate to admit it, Trump has proven to be right on just about everything regarding foreign or domestic policy and is a proven hands on strong leader - something we desparately need right now and don't have. Every other GOP candidate in recent memory promises things, but after being elected does either nothing or very little happens. If you have ever wondered why Trump is so hated, the answer is simple, it is because the Washington establishment can't control him because he doesn't need their money. Money is how the establishment controls politicians, regardless of party. This is why no matter how good the person running for office is, when he or she gets to Washington they are forced to conform with the wishes of the swamp.

"Embezzlement and Retaliation Lawsuit:
In a separate case, De Niro filed a lawsuit against another former employee, accusing her of embezzlement, misuse of company credit cards, and theft of time. This countersuit came after she had already sued him for gender discrimination and retaliation3.
The legal battle between De Niro and his former employees has been ongoing.
Verbal Outbursts:
During the trial, De Niro had a dramatic outburst in court. He looked directly at his former assistant and shouted, ""Shame on you!""2.
He also admitted to occasionally berating her and raising his voice but denied being abusive. However, the jury found in favor of Robinson.
Allegations of Abusive Behavior:
Robinson testified that De Niro and his girlfriend teamed up against her, turning a job she once loved into a nightmare1.
De Niro conceded that he had asked her to scratch his back on at least two occasions but dismissed it as harmless2.
Despite these controversies, Robert De Niro remains a prominent figure in the entertainment industry, known for his exceptional acting talent and collaborations with renowned directors. ",1

"Embezzlement and Retaliation Lawsuit:
In a separate case, De Niro filed a lawsuit against another former employee, accusing her of embezzlement, misuse of company credit cards, and theft of time. This countersuit came after she had already sued him for gender discrimination and retaliation3.
The legal battle between De Niro and his former employees has been ongoing.
Verbal Outbursts:
During the trial, De Niro had a dramatic outburst in court. He looked directly at his former assistant and shouted, ""Shame on you!""2.
He also admitted to occasionally berating her and raising his voice but denied being abusive. However, the jury found in favor of Robinson.
Allegations of Abusive Behavior:
Robinson testified that De Niro and his girlfriend teamed up against her, turning a job she once loved into a nightmare1.
De Niro conceded that he had asked her to scratch his back on at least two occasions but dismissed it as harmless2.
Despite these controversies, Robert De Niro remains a prominent figure in the entertainment industry, known for his exceptional acting talent and collaborations with renowned directors. ",1

"@joshuakelly9390  explain how it is illegal. 
The First Amendment prevents CONGRESS from infringement on a citizen's right to free speech; the judicial branch is a separate entity. The judiciary has the authority to limit a criminal defendant's speech with regards to a criminal proceeding for the purpose of protecting witnesses, the jury, the general public, and the defendant (akin to the Fifth Amendment, instructing the defendant to adhere to a gag order prevents him from incriminating himself, which he managed to do). It's not illegal; it is what judges are within their authority to do. 
The guy's still able to talk about whatever else, just not aspects of the current court case, like any other criminal defendant. If only he had something else to run on.",0

"He said there is ""not one redeemable thing about him"" so from his view, a mob boss or any other of the characters he has played, they need to have enough there for the audience to connect to them. All these movies are about characters falling from grace, digging their own grave etc. The way De Niro talks, to him there is no grace and hence he couldn't play a character that has nothing good about him. Such a character would belong in a horror movie.",1
"He said why. Trump ""has no redeeming qualities.""",0

"This is how a con artist operates.  They find out where you hurt and the make you believe that THEY are the only one that can solve your pain.   Add to that a so called cable news channel that validates the promises of the con artist, and that's a HUGE recipe for the con artist assuming power. 

And we forget that we have a LOT of people who are hurting in this country and feel abandoned.  Many feel ""the system"" failed them or moved around them.  Now enter a con artist who promises to kick the old system to the curb to win them justice!  They begin to treat him as their savior.   Now you're fighting a powerful influence as strong as a religion.   

He has successfully orchestrated a strategy to win the hearts of those who are either greedy or hurting.  Especially who have been forgotten or people who feel this country just hasn't been fair to them.",1

"Talking in circles... I used to like DeNiro... But this is just name calling. Definitely Pot and Kettle. I remember 3 years ago, De Niro was filing for bankruptcy and now getting paid to do little fluff interviews on garbage tv. I wonder how much he is paid to talk out the side of his face?",0
Wait! He compared Trump to Hitler! I voted for Biden and now spend twice as much money to live than when racist Trump was in office. Something doesn't add up. De Niro stick to acting.,1
"DeNiro is disappointing and dangerous frankly. 
You compare Trump to Hitler? Just horrible!",0
Sort of like saying a fly unleashes on a horse.,1
De Niro you are an actor nothing more and now broke,1
I respected DeNiro before but a whole lot more now. People need to listen to his message...nails it..,1

Right on Robert De Niro!,1
"this man De Niro is a true man who will tell it like it is . Here in Europe we laugh and joke about trump , disbelief that he became president , how? well he played a lot of people , knows how to play the public , play on their fears . The media machine and rally's are on full steam but he cant last this uphill task , he is looking extremely tired . The power he needs will bring him down. America wake up and don't make this a comedy . If you do dig your grave then i am sorry,  but there will be no mercy. Trump is still a boy , spoilt rotten ,  we need more De Neros",1
Thanks Steph! Thank you Robert de Nero. - brave heart in the right place!!!,1

He needs to focus on being an actor ...what a waste  air time.,0
Deniro is 10000% right and no different than i been saying for years.,1
Excellent interview let’s hope people listen to Mr De Niro! Love him so spot  on .,1
Does he say any particular thing that Trump did actually wrong as president? Just saying you don't like someone and call him names is something 5-year-olds do. Does he really prefer Biden and his family profiting from Ukraine? Are people really this shallow and dumb?,0
"Ok the last time trump was president the economy was great gas was 1.89 there was no wars , what is he crying about, Trump is the best president ever",1
"Thank you, Mr. De Niro, for seeing and speaking so clearly!!!",1
What’s absurd is the fact deniro is 80 and just had another baby.,0

"Quiet sad really De Niro is not aging well, calls Trump sick but never actually names why, just talk in general terms. He's just an old has been actor.  Why isn't De Niro standing by bi.den's side and supporting him, take in some of those nice new soon to be American citizens crossing the border into his home? I'm sure he has the room and the money, come on Robert support your President, you've talked the talk now walk the walk.",1
He's genuinely a corrupt corrupt individual just rotten to the Core,0

Words from a true legend! Democracy is about what's right vs wrong!,1
Robert De Niro said he wants to use his platform to talk bad about Trump.. How about he uses it to entertain us like he is paid to do. Nobody cares about your political views. How about doing a little digging for yourself and see what he has done  personally to help  unfortunate people before and when he was president..,0
"Sovereign Lord, King of Kings, Almighty Father,

I humbly beseech You for the blessing and protection of our nation. A roaring lion, evil prowls the earth, seeking to destroy. Deliver us, O Lord, from this darkness, from the wicked schemes of the enemy. 

Shine Your light upon our leaders, revealing those whose hearts are not aligned with Your divine purpose. Our nation cries out for righteous guidance, for we are adrift in chaos and confusion.

Dispatch Your heavenly armies to stand beside those who fight for truth and justice. Empower them with unwavering strength to resist temptation and evil. Clothe them in the full armor of God, wielding Your Word as a mighty sword against the adversary.

In the powerful and victorious name of Jesus Christ, I pray. Amen.",0

You are so right sir!,1
"In most all of his movies De Niro is either stabbing someone, killing people,  ordering someone to be killed or torturing someone. Extremely violent in many cases. Unfortunately audiences cannot differ between movies made to excite and reality, and the violence often plays out in real life. Too many examples. Is this not part of the evil in today's society? Think about it.",0
He did not say single one specific thing why is Trump bad/dangerous etc. Is it because he prefers US flag over LGBT or Ukraine or Palestine or anybody's others flags?,0
Wow one arrogant man talking badly about another arrogant man. An expert actor should stick to acting.,0

"Pakistani Army in Gaza as peacekeepers : 
The US is in talks with several countries since past 6 months for a multinational peacekeeping security force for Gaza funded by USA as soon as the war ends. These troops will not be from USA. If there is no two-state agreement first then Saudi Arabia and Qatar are unlikely to provide troops. Jordan and Egypt could be more cooperative without a two-state agreement as preference is for Arab speaking troops and for those countries which Israel approves. The peacekeepers would help in humanitarian aid, security, etc. However, the peace keeping force will not be totally neutral as Hamas fighters still need to be controlled from coming back. The peace keepers will act so that Israel maintains some measure of control over Gaza. In effect the peace keepers could become a proxy outsourced Army for Israel if there is no two-state agreement in future. 

In Dec 2023 the Pakistan Army Chief was in USA and had several meetings with State Dept. and Military officials in Pentagon. A State Dept. Team was in Pakistan this week discussing ""regional security"". Given the bankrupted state of Pakistan it would not be surprising that Pakistan Army troops are sent to Gaza as peacekeepers ""to help with humanitarian aid distribution to Muslim Palestinian brothers"" for urgently needed dollars. The above potential role of Pakistan would be another reason why USA has largely ignored the serious Human Rights violations and a US Presidential letter was written quickly accepting the rigged 2024 Govt. The Iranian President which supports Hamas had met with the Army Chief in Pakistan recently.",1

I told that economic issues in Pakistan are temporary. Pakistan will be fine in medium to long term.,1
Boys in Pakistan should now make more noise,1
"Pakistan's geo strategic location is key. Pakistan's Army offers its Army's services, Natural resources, port, Terrorists/Militants, Airports for drones, create problem for Iran/Afghanistan/India/China. Lot of countries interested. Pakistan's Generals normally sell their services for West's Paszsport/citizenship",1

"Many Pakistan in Malaysia and South East Asia already. They're rich people there.
All money goes to Pakistan",1
"What will be left of Pakistan at the end of this spree of handing over valuable resources to the investors? Probably, only radical islamists, terrorists and poverty. None of the benefits of this investment will go to common people. Army takes half the benefits and politicians and bureaucrsts, the rest.",0
OMG the muslim world has totally played Modi. First they made connections with India with oil temptations and and now they want to invest in Pakistan (only muslim country with nuclear weapons) and make them strong enough to compete with India. India's RAW cant even interrupt these new investments as they did in Balochistan (China silk road project) since India has established diplomatic and trade connections with West Asia. I think Saudi are trying to get nuclear capable as Iran is closing in.,1
There is no logic to invest in such a worst country and all this looks crap.,0

"There is one major difference.

ISLAM, which by its very nature considers itself the best and only one. That claim by its followers is itself a recipe for disaster.
People give example of Europe after WW2, but they didn't have multiple religions to deal with, particularly ISLAM.",1
"It's not about people, it's about government's vision... And Pakistan government has no vision for development, otherwise if India, Pakistan and other asian countries can come together then we can easily become strong",1
"It's not the right time to invest in a country like Pakistan. I am practically saying this, not because of grudge or hatred",1
"Please make less videos on Pak affairs, people are fed up. Once a week is more than enough. Give more info on west, Japan, Germany and China.",1

"Palki u are a biased nationalist..another one to the mix..

We need honest journalists not another ideology driven journalist. You may see yourself as some hero who is fighting behalf of your country..but put a little more thought into it you are just another ideology driven journalist who puts ideology over truth..

Shameful and pathetic",0

Tracking the story of pakistan but not reporting about manipal and other states and their misery,0
"This channel is so biased . Any thing happened in India is good, anything happened in Pakistan is bad ",1
"Palki is always worried for Pakistan than her own country. 

She has lot to malign about other countries esp Pakistan, USA, UK and Canada


You guys are privatizing and I guess mind your own business and stop interfering on other countries affairs esp Pakistan. We damn care for India but you guys have all the time to talk about us.

Inke hath mai sonne Kay lota bhi ajaye to inko bhik hi mangna hai.  thi line is best fitting on Pakistan  ,1
" @sbains6176  who really cares what Palki Sharma thinks because she can not Think, she works on a script and for that you dont need brains. india neither has natural resources or mineral wealth, Pakistan has and this will continue to attract investors. By the way, Canadian authorities have arrested four indian national concerning Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Just wait and see how people will try to prove an innocent india !!",1
"It's ironic that Indians, who have always been Pak's detractors, seem to have forgotten that the US recently replaced India in Quad with the Philippines. Indians must come to understand that their hatred of Pakistan does not in any way demonstrate their patriotism. India may be in serious trouble as the US is gradually losing faith in India. In order to boost its economic expansion and fortify its diplomatic connections, India required the leverage that the US could provide it in the West. Oddly enough, the US no longer needs India to oppose China—it now needs the Philippines.",0
Worst anchor ever,0
Privatisation is the first steps towards the end of democracy… but if you have no energy resources you are in a bad situation… should have built hydro dams and other renewable energy infrastructure with what energy you had .. don’t worry you won’t be alone.. a lot of other countries are headed down the same sht pipe..,0
Pakistan  Russia friendship is important  love from Dubai,1
"Although Pakistan's leadership is dysfunctional today, it is still a very populous country and greater population means increased consumption, and higher consumption leads to a higher GDP and in 50 years, Pakistan is estimated to have a GDP of 13 trillion dollars so West Asia is investing in a country poised to become a multi-trillion-dollar economy in the future.",1
fake news,0
"Philippines does not have the military power to match with China. Their navy is too little to deal with a behemoth. Also, for your note, Indian in quad does'nt mean those members will come to India in military aid to support against China during war. India knows that these are not the same cold war times when it had to depend on USSR for military  and diplomatic assistance as their back up. Now it has to deal these kind of situations currently on it's own.",0
